<div class="post">
  <p>Yup, they’re getting later and later at the moment, but here’s the Film Fight for July, with 4 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>How To Train Your Dragon 2</strong> is a fun-enough sequel to what was a pretty good kids movie. It’s not a masterpiece, feeling a little formulaic at times, but it really didn’t have to be a classic. There are sad moments, fun moments, exciting moments. It does its job of being an entertaining, if light-hearted, film. Enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/487890508900212736">my How To Train Your Dragon 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Boyhood</strong> is a fascinating experiment: director Richard Linklater assembled his cast every year for a few weeks, ostensibly so we can see the 7-year old boy at the centre of the film turn into a 19-year old man. While the pacing doesn’t always work, it’s great to see the actors improve year-on-year. While Ellar Coltrane, as the lead, sees the most obvious evolution, it’s great to see now-seasoned actors, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, going from serviceable at the start to great towards the end. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/488304043136389121">my Boyhood Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a surprisingly good reboot of the franchise, so it was going to be interesting to see where its sequel, <strong>Dawn of the Planet of The Apes</strong>, went next. There’s a significant time jump and the human population is all but wiped out as the film begins. A small group stumble into Caesar (the ape leader) and his new family, causing tensions to rise. While the supporting cast are sketched in overly broad strokes, the leads are well-drawn characters forced into worsening situations. There are a number of missteps (the music is overwrought, the apes using guns is never earned) but it remains entertaining. A solid action/adventure. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/492027135683751936">my Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Purge: Anarchy</strong> takes the silly premise of The Purge (that for one night a year no crime is illegal) into a new direction. Where the original was a home-invasion horror, Anarchy is more of a suspense-thriller, in the mould of Judgement Night. Viewed through that almost B-movie lens, it’s an entertaining film. There aren’t many surprises, but the action keeps the pace up nicely. Good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/494889666706165760">my The Purge: Anarchy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>For July, the winner is <strong>Boyhood</strong>, for being such an interesting cinematic undertaking.</p>

  <p>Yes, I let film fight go for a number of months without update. I’m starting it again now, with the March update and should be back up-to-date by the time this month ends.</p>

<p>First up is <strong>A Guide to Recognising Your Saints</strong>, an autobiographical tale of a boy trying to escape the insular world in which he inhabits and become more than his parents. The story largely focuses on the hardships and maniac friends the protagonist keeps during childhood, and flips between showing his past and him occasionally revisiting it as a grown-up. Although there are some powerful, emotionally charged scenes between the lead and his father, the film itself is fairly hollow. It’s a standard coming-of-age story, which is a little too self indulgent.</p>

<p>Comedy: <strong>School for Scoundrels</strong> is a remake of the classic film, about a guy who goes to classes to learn how to be a bit better with the ladies. Billy Bob Thornton is perfectly cast as the devious, double-crossing teacher; doling out advice and stealing girls from the star performers. A fairly silly and lightweight film that won’t win any awards, but does entertain.</p>

<p>With <strong>The Prestige</strong> setting a fairly high bar in the magic and revenge themes only a few months ago, <strong>The Illusionist</strong> had a lot to live up to: it failed miserably. Using fairly weak CGI rather than stage magic is one mistake that can be forgiven if the plot is adequate but, sadly, it isn’t. It’s predictable, lazy, and lacks any real impact; certainly a weaker moment in Ed Norton’s career.</p>

<p>Finally, Matt Damon stars as a CIA spy back in the founding era of the agency in <strong>The Good Shepherd</strong>. Rather than focus on action, as is the vogue, it explores the cost of his dedication on his family life and the lengths to which he will go to protect them, despite an increasing distance between them. Ultimately, we know he put himself in this position, but we can’t help but feel sorry for Damon’s character as his life slips away. Beautifully shot, and with an air of authority, any shortcomings in pace are made up for in craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Though it may have struggled in a stronger month, <strong>The Good Shepherd</strong> is the only real candidate for March’s winner.</p>

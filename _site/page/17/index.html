  <h3><a href="/Archives/2014/04/06/film-fight-2014-january/">Film Fight 2014: January</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A new year, a new start for Film Fight. It’s been a busy start to the year so this is coming quite late. Three films for January:</p>

<p>First up, <strong>American Hustle</strong> has the kind of cast that you know you’re not going to have to worry about. They’ll turn in great performances and nail whatever you throw at them. That’s precisely what happens here, save for a few comically over-the-top moments. Leaving the cast aside, then, we’re left with a wildly unevenly paced film. At times, we get a barrage of clips, being narrated by the leads, at other times nothing much happens for 15 minutes. Given the lengthy runtime, this starts to become problematic. An entertaining film, with fun performances, but not a classic.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/419063170179686400">my American Hustle Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Similarly, <strong>12 Years A Slave</strong> has some of the most stunning performances of the Oscar season. Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the titular slave, is as fantastic when he’s trying to keep his head down as when he’s being brutalised by one of his masters. Likewise, Michael Fassbender’s portrayal of the cotton plantation owner is shocking and unnerving; bringing a genuinely frightening presence. We see the same level of performance from the rest of the cast, except for one minor but pivotal role that seemed quite out of place. It’s tough to watch the lingering, violent shots but it’s certainly worthwhile. An excellent film. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/424594229713596417">my 12 Years A Slave Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong> is a fantastic, comic take on some of the worst excesses that came out of the world of stockbrokers. Based on a true story, it follows a mans rise from nobody to head of his own stockbroking firm; a position he gets to through lying, stealing and cheating, while indulging in every excess imaginable. The 18 rating on the film is well-deserved, given the copious sex and drug-taking scenes that make up the bulk of the film. The film is entertaining with a wonderful cast, but at three hours is vastly longer than it needs to be, knocking at least half an hour off would lose nothing of substance. Fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/427393737509990400">my Wolf of Wall Street Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>It’ll be no surprise to say that <strong>12 Years A Slave</strong> is the first winner of the year.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/12/31/film-fight-2013-finale/">Film Fight 2013: Finale</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Twelve film fights later and we’ve got another finale. As always, <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2012/12/31/film-fight-2012-finale/">my caveat from earlier years still applies</a>: Film Fight is done in a knock-out style and, as such, only picks my favourite film of the year; there are no guarantees about second place.</p>

<p>First up, the films that were good but that did not win their month i.e. the honourable mentions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lincoln</li>
  <li>Zero Dark Thirty</li>
  <li>Robot and Frank</li>
  <li>Compliance</li>
  <li>Trance</li>
  <li>Mud</li>
  <li>The Iceman</li>
  <li>World War Z</li>
  <li>This Is The End</li>
  <li>The East</li>
  <li>The World’s End</li>
  <li>Monster’s University</li>
  <li>Kick-Ass 2</li>
  <li>Filth</li>
  <li>How I Live Now</li>
  <li>Machete Kills</li>
  <li>Captain Phillips</li>
  <li>Anchorman 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the monthly winners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: <strong>Django Unchained</strong></li>
  <li>February: <strong>Wreck-It Ralph</strong></li>
  <li>March: <strong>Cloud Atlas</strong></li>
  <li>April: <strong>The Place Beyond the Pines</strong></li>
  <li>May: <strong>Upstream Color</strong></li>
  <li>June: <strong>Much Ado About Nothing</strong></li>
  <li>July: <strong>Pacific Rim</strong></li>
  <li>August: <strong>Lovelace</strong></li>
  <li>September: <strong>The Way, Way Back</strong></li>
  <li>October: <strong>Prisoners</strong></li>
  <li>November: <strong>Gravity</strong></li>
  <li>December: <strong>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The winners, as a whole, don’t seem quite as high-quality as some other years, but there are some absolutely fantastic films in there. <strong>The Place Beyond the Pines</strong> is a powerful look at privilege and family ties. <strong>Upstream Color</strong> is a wonderfully hypnotic piece of story telling that pulls off its dreamy feel far better than similar films. In <strong>Pacific Rim</strong> we have the monster movie done well: the story is nonsense but the fights are fun and have weight, despite being CG. <strong>Lovelace</strong> has two of the best lead performances of the year. While <strong>Gravity</strong> is spectacular visual storytelling, gripping throughout.</p>

<p>The winner, though, as predicted back in June, is Joss Whedon’s take on <strong>Much Ado About Nothing</strong>. It’s suitably breezy, funny, delightful, wonderfully shot, and rammed full of excellent performances. This is an absolute masterclass on making Shakespeare feel relevant today, without dumbing down the source material. A well-deserved win.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/12/31/film-fight-2013-december/">Film Fight 2013: December</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A very quiet December, with only two films viewed.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</strong> is that rare sequel that manages to be confidently better than the original in almost every regard. The pacing of the film is excellent, moving through months of propaganda in minutes without feeling rushed before settling into a slower, but still lively, pace for the main events. It’s a little darker, the situation unravels a little more and, most importantly, I actually cared about what happened to most of the characters by the end; something I can’t really say about the original. The ending marks it very much as the middle chapter of the series, but it had done enough by that point that a cliff-hanger ending didn’t seem unfair. Well worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/414704213499715584">my The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</strong>, on the other hand, was never going to live up to the original, which was likely my most watched comedy of the preceeding ten years. Let’s be clear: it’s a good comedy, better than most of the competition, and with some incredibly funny moments (Doby!). In fact, for the first hour it seems like it might just pull off getting into the same league as the original. Sadly, it begins retreading the same plot arc as the original, and the same jokes. While the supporting cast are still great (Brick is a particular highlight), it’s Ron Burgundy that seems a little off. Rather than being the out-of-time, dumb, but loveable anchorman, he is played as an amped-up-to-eleven version of the original; a louder, pantomine parody. Again, it’s a good film, it’s funny, but it’s not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/414704891345375232">my Anchorman 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The final monthly winner for 2013, then, is <strong>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.</strong> An unexpectedly fun sequel.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/12/30/film-fight-2013-november/">Film Fight 2013: November</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For the November Film Fight, we have 4 films.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa</strong> is an attempt to take the over-the-top pranks of Jackass and try to cram them into a story, with mixed success. It plays out in a similar fashion to much of Sascha Baron Cohen’s work, like Borat or Bruno: unsuspecting members of the public play against the characters in ridiculous situations to see how they react. It’s dumb and mean-spirited humour of the lowest form, albeit done very well. This film won’t change your mind about Johnny Knoxville and his brand of humour, but if you already find it funny then this is a pretty good example of the genre. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/397487061801791488">my Bad Grandpa Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Captain Phillips</strong> seems bizarrely tone-deaf. At times, the story of a tanker captain taken hostage by Somali pirates is remarkably tense and, despite knowing the ending, you can’t help but be drawn in by every twist. Hanks puts in his usual, down-to-Earth and absolutely spot-on performance, with no surprises, with the Somali pirates coming across with jagged believability. However, at other times, it goes way too far in one direction or another. The opening with Catherine Keener is so underplayed that no-one appears to be making any effort. Contrast that with the many Oscar-baiting moments later, and you have a film that, while very good on the whole, can’t seem to decide what to do with itself. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/401486572849078272">my Captain Phillips Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The next entry in Marvel’s cinematic universe is <strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong>. The lead character isn’t the most cerebral in Marvel’s canon, and that is fully on display here. Expect the usual “smash, drink and nobility” sentiments wrapped around a plot where Thor saves everyone from world-ending doom. So, nothing new. That’s not to say it’s bad. Thor is fun and dumb, and I’m not sure anything else would work. Loki is as great as ever, playing the meddlesome brother, but the main bad guy, Malekith, is so generic that you wonder why they brought in as great an actor as Christopher Ecclestone to do the part. The film, then, is ultimately fun and fine, but you’ve seen it many times before. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/401818759737790464">my Thor: The Dark World Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Gravity</strong> is Alfonso Cuaron’s way of following up the his 2006 Film Fight finalist, Children of Men. It is an astounding piece of film that, I believe, cannot be done full justice in a home-viewing setting. The 3D IMAX screenings draw you in better than anything else I’ve seen in the format, with the eye-filling frames giving you nowhere to look for respite. The story itself is a little saccharine at times, but that’s largely beside the point. The film is a journey that mixes moments of eerie calm with uncontrolled frantic action. I don’t want to say too much about the content, other than it’s a thrilling movie, with a great lead performance and great support. Definitely see this in as big a format as you can. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/403298583354408961">my Gravity Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for November is <strong>Gravity</strong>, a film that was worth waiting seven years to see.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/11/24/film-fight-2013-october/">Film Fight 2013: October</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">Five films in the Film Fight for October…</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">First up, <strong>Filth</strong> is a film in the Irvine Welsh tradition: an anti-hero swept into a maddening situation of his own making, presented in a surreal technicolour, before dropping into a cold, dank reality. That Filth isn’t anything new doesn’t mean it’s bad, it’s not. James McAvoy does a fantastic job of showing the breakdown of a cop who was always a little on the edge. Supported by a fun cast, he is certainly the film’s highlight. The film is somewhat undone by the weirdness. While it mostly fits the portrayal, it sometimes lacks a point beyond being strange. Overall, the film is decent, but could’ve been better. A film to watch, rather than rewatch. (See </span><a style="line-height: 1.4;" href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/386857762451243008">my Filth Twitter review</a><span style="line-height: 1.4;">).</span></p>

<p><strong>How I Live Now</strong> is the story of an American girl who comes to stay a summer with her cousins in rural England. Unfortunately, a devastating war breaks out whilst no adults are around. The film could’ve descended into a crude Lord of the Flies rip-off at this point but it doesn’t. Instead it does an excellent job of building a new survivalist world in the background, the young cast slipping into it seamlessly as the world collapses around them. There are many excellent moments of despair (that I won’t spoil) but the film is somewhat let down by a flimsy central romance, hints of psychic abilities that go nowhere (apparently they’re more important in the book), and more than a few lines of clunky dialogue delivered poorly by the youngest actors in the cast. All in, it’s a beautifully presented work, let down by the details. One to see. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/388384958579875840">my How I Live Now Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Wherever you sit on the Wiki Leaks debate, <strong>The Fifth Estate</strong> should’ve been an interesting insight into the organisation’s early days and founders. While Benedict Cumberbatch puts in an excellent performance as a controlling, jealous and paranoid Assange and Daniel Brühl does a good job of playing his level-headed counterpart, they can’t save the film from its many flaws. When it has to lower itself to silly CG office spaces filled with countless copies of Assange to explain the technology of the organisation, you know that it’s not going to get better. A real shame, given the meaty subject. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/391936126996336640">my The Fifth Estate Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The problem with <strong>Prisoners</strong> is that it’s an afternoon murder mystery with torture porn set-dressing: it has the cliched attempts to mislead of the former, and the unnecessary and over-the-top suffering of the latter. I don’t really want either. The cast can’t be held responsible here, as everyone puts in an outstanding performance; from Jackman’s angry father-figure to Dano’s disturbed young man, the principle actors do a great job. It’s a shame, then, that they don’t get better material with which to work. You’ll see many of the attempts to fool you coming, as not one hasn’t been seen many times before. All of that said, when it lets Jackman’s character go off-the-rails, things can get remarkably tense. Just how far will he go to save his daughter? Good, but not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/394127155665199104">my Prisoners Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re looking for a ridiculous, over-the-top action film with lots of B-movie trimmings, then <strong>Machete Kills</strong> will work for you. It’s not as well made or silly as the original, but you’re unlikely to care. You’ll get the intentionally terrible dialogue, wonky effects, explosions and half-baked characters you’d expect from a grindhouse film. Enjoy after a drink or two for maximum impact. (see <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/394127813269139456">my Machete Kills Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for October is Prisoners. It’s not a strong winner, but the best of a fun-to-average bunch.</p>

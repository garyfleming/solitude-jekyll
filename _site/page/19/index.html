  <div class="post">
    <p>There are six films in the Film Fight for April, making it quite a busy month…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Compliance</strong> is a worrying look at control, and how someone that seems like an authority figure can cause serious problems without being questioned. Based on a true story, it shows how a man posing as a police officer over the phone talks the manager of a fast food place into some highly questionable behaviour. It explores its theme well, despite overextending a few scenes to pad out the paltry runtime. The performances are reasonable, and the film manages to hold interest despite a few pacing issues. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/319559547440230401">my Compliance Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Trance</strong> is the latest work by director, Danny Boyle. It’s a typically stylish and slick heist movie about the theft of a painting, with all the hallmarks of a Boyle movie. That includes the expected last-act twist, which is so utterly predictable and surrounded by silliness as to fall apart under its own weight. Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson were both great, but the rest of the film was hampered by the ridiculous premise. Watchable, but not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/320483658995740672">my Trance Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Maniac</strong> is an entirely forgettable, modern-day, B-movie slasher film. Its one gimmick, the point of view camera, starts to lose its appeal very quickly, and forces the film to rely on cliche: the killer with mother issues, obsession with (essentially) dolls, people that can’t run away or make silly choices etc. There’s nothing in this film that you haven’t seen many times before, so there’s very little reason to see it again. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/320485707242168320">my Maniac Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A brilliant cast, lead by Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, makes <strong>The Place Beyond The Pines</strong> a particularly bold movie. It compares the actions and decisions of three men over the course of several decades to show how blurry the line between good and bad is, how only a handful of choices and circumstance keep us from going down much darker paths. The narrative is sprawling, but never confusing, and the arguments it makes are convincing. It’s let down, in part, by a weak final act, focussing a little too much on weaker characters brought together by serendipity. A classic film that deserves to be remembered. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/324633989249908736">my The Place Beyond The Pines Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Spring Breakers</strong>, meanwhile, follows a handful of young girls as they head off the rails in an attempted satire of selfishness and hedonism. It attempts this by painting a dream-like, neon unreality; glitches in the cutting used to put multiple takes together, with a never ending stream of music. Sadly, it fails utterly in its goal. It comes across, for the most part, as sluggish and dull. There’s no substance here, or even a strong message, just vague ideas presented vaguely. Awful. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/324995658308259841">my Spring Breakers Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Olympus Has Fallen</strong> was being billed by some as a modern take on Die Hard, as the most recent Die Hard films are nothing like the original. It doesn’t live up to that, but it is a surprisingly fun, if utterly dumb, action film. There are a whole heap of big action set pieces to keep you interested (including a surprising opening sequence). These help hide the many plot holes. If you notice those, you’re paying attention to the wrong things. This is an unabashed, straight-up action film; sensible plotting be damned. Enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/326448792067002369">my Olympus Has Fallen Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner this month is <strong>The Place Beyond the Pines</strong>, for its many excellent choices.</p>

    <p>A slightly better showing this month than last, with 5 new films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Cloud Atlas</strong> is a sprawling, epic story by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. It’s made up of six stories, each set in a different time period, but with the same cast members playing roles in each. The stories intertwine to various degrees, but you shouldn’t try and closely follow the logical connections: the film is much more about the thematic connections between the stories, particularly those that lead into the far future. We get some very good performances, particularly from Halle Berry and Tom Hanks who do a wide-range of characters, from the grubby and desperate to relatively heroic. This is an excellent film that is worth seeing at least once, but you’ll probably want to see it again. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/308285368086700032">my Cloud Atlas Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Stoker</strong>, from Park Chan-wook, is that most disappointing kind of film: one for which the trailer does an extremely good job of setting up a mood and atmosphere, which the film itself utterly fails to deliver. Most of the drama is so obviously telegraphed that you’ll see it coming from very early on, which seems to have lead the film makers to believe that they don’t then have to earn those moments. There are a number of places where characters do things that don’t emanate from themselves, but are there because the plot mandated it. This leads to some terribly stilted dialogue, and leaden scenes. All in all, there’s very little redeeming here. Dreadful. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/309069375917412353">my Stoker Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>I’ve never felt that The Wizard of Oz really needed any more backstory, but given the number of people attempting to provide just that, I am clearly in the minority. <strong>Oz: The Great and Powerful</strong> shows how the great wizard, Oz, came to be ruler of the Emerald City. It’s a nice enough take (he was originally a con-man magician) but, being aimed at children, there’s only so much they can do with the premise. While it doesn’t stand up to the slightest bit of scrutiny, it is at least a fun film with a few decent laughs in there, though I can’t quite remember what they were now. Fun, but entirely forgettable.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/313284056840302592">my Oz: The Great and Powerful Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Robot and Frank</strong> is the surprisingly sweet tale of a former cat burglar who, in his old age, gets a a helper robot. After the fairly predictable beginning (old man hates robot, old man grows to like robot), it settles down into a lovely story. At times it’s genuinely touching and sweet, and at others it’s very funny, particularly when it does something quite unexpected. The various subplots eventually pay off into a few moments that really make the film. Frank Langella is great as the lead and Susan Sarandon does fine as the love interest, but both James Marsden and Liv Tyler seemed fairly half-hearted. That aside, it’s a wonderful film. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/313285056623935488">my Robot and Frank Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Paperboy</strong> is a bit of an in-cohesive mess. There are a number of ideas being progressed, from youthful arrogance, to seeking danger, to not always really knowing those who you should be close to. The setting, a baking hot summer in smalltown Florida, seems like a good boiling pot for the themes, but none of them ever really heat up and turn into the driving force of a film. We end up with a half-cooked stew of bits and pieces that don’t fit particularly well. There are some excellent performances (John Cusack is great as a slimy Floridian swamp dweller) and it captures the feel of the moment well, but there are too many structural issues for that to matter. Disappointing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/316324238413938688">my The Paperboy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A tough month to call, but I think <strong>Cloud Atlas</strong> wins due to the scope of its vision, and all the moments it does deliver well, even though there are a few that fail to work.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/04/01/film-fight-2013-february/">Film Fight 2013: February</a></h1>

    <p>Yes, I know, I’m continuing a bad trend for late posts this year. February has only 3 films, after the big hitters coming out in January leaving slim pickings this month.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Flight</strong> is a film about substance abuse that at times works very well, and at other times goes wide of the mark. The first act, depicting a horrific plane crash that ends miraculously, is exceptionally well done; the sound engineers using the increasingly high-pitched engine noises to great effect, as well as a few other neat little tricks. The entire section is gripping. When the film moves on to its real material, that’s when it starts to flounder. The scenes in which it deals with the main character’s alcohol abuse head on tend to work relatively well. However there are too many sections that are either very forced (most of the material with his family) or are comically over-the-top, particularly the religious messages that are, at times, so heavy-handed as to be laugh-out-loud funny. In a movie about such a serious subject, these flaws seriously detract. The entire film could’ve been a lot better. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/300019366383194112">my Flight Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>We tend not to expect too much from animated movies aimed at children, particularly when Pixar aren’t involved, so it’s a surprise to see such a fun movie in <strong>Wreck-It Ralph</strong>. The initial hook of a videogame villain who wants his life to mean more plays out quite nicely, with a number of great cameos and spoofs of other games. From there it builds into a funny but sweet story of finding where you belong, even if you’re a bit different than everyone else. It’s not going to be a classic, but it is certainly worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/301428289732476928">my Wreck-It Ralph Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Warm Bodies</strong> is a story about semi-conscious zombies who find that love can help them be better people. It’s not particularly well fleshed out (pardon the pun), much of the plot happening because it’s convenient rather than it making any kind of sense, but it is sweet at times. Okay. (see <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/305389872192049153">my Warm Bodies Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for February, then, is <strong>Wreck-It Ralph</strong>: a sweet animation about belonging, that manages to be funny along the way.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/03/04/film-fight-2013-january/">Film Fight 2013: January</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Welcome to Film Fight 2013. I know I’m a little late in starting the main posts, but the <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming" title="my Twitter account">Twitter</a> reviews have been up in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Impossible</strong> is the kind of overwrought, Hollywood, Oscar-bait that rolls around at the start of the year. It’s full of wide awe shots, big orchestral strains over moments we’re supposed to know are Emotional (yes, with a capital letter). That said, there are some fantastic moments of panic where they play things a little bit more subtly and it pays off, and even more where they show the brutal side of a natural disaster and it’s extremely affecting. It’s an okay film, but could have done with a lighter touch: the events portrayed were interesting enough to not need the heavy-handed manipulation. <span style="line-height: 1.4;">(See </span><a style="line-height: 1.4;" href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/287562093115359234">my The Impossible Twitter review</a><span style="line-height: 1.4;">).</span></p>

<p><strong>Gangster Squad</strong> falls flat at almost every level. At times it tries to be pulp but tries to take too serious a tone for that to work, whilst at other times it really heads into schlock territory. The performances, despite a ridiculously good cast, are all over the chart: Sean Penn chews up the scenery as well as he always does, but the rest of the cast are very variable. Worst of all, though, is the awful colour-grading throughout. It’s not only the over-the-top, offensive, teal-and-orange colouring that grates, it’s how terribly inconsistent it is. Had the film committed to a tone, it might have worked but, as it stands, it’s a mess. Avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/289514577203449856">my Gangster Squad Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>It’s not often you see a sung-through musical being turned into a film, but <strong>Les Miserables</strong> is that to an extreme: an A-list cast and a large budget, making sure everything you see has sky-high production values. It certainly looks fantastic throughout, and there are some very impressive moments. Anne Hathaway deserves her Oscar, despite her relatively brief appearance, for such an excellent performance, for example. However, the film suffers from a leaden pace. After an initial burst, it seems to take a very long time to get anywhere. Partly good, and partly bad, then. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/290974240872751104">my Les Miserables Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Quentin Tarantino has a particular style that oozes through all of his movies. Sometimes it’s played a bit more over the top, as it is in Kill Bill pt. 1, and sometimes it’s played more seriously, as it is in Reservoir Dogs, but you can always see it. <strong>Django Unchained</strong> is unmistakably a Tarantino movie, and one that manages to play both sides reasonably well. When Django is doling out justice as a freed slave there can be a real sense of comic-book heroism, and at other times in the movie the violence can be brutal and horrific. The performances help sell it all, with both Fox and Di Caprio putting in great performances but Christoph Waltz stealing the show more often than not. It’s not always easy to watch, but it’s always a great film; well, maybe not that one bit with Tarantino’s cameo, but we’ll forget about that for now. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/294587337097224192">my Django Unchained Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>As titles go <strong>Lincoln</strong> is more than a little misleading. You might mistakenly believe that it’s a biopic about the man’s life but it almost entirely focuses on the month leading up to the addition of the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery. The performances are as strong as the cast is wide, the sheer volume of great actors alone making it worth watching. Daniel Day-Lewis puts in another world-class performance, but it’s Sally Fields who really stands out with her brilliant portrayal of Lincoln’s wife. That said, the film is more than a little slow. While it’s important to be delicate to the subject matter, there are a lot of dead ends that should have been excised. Worth seeing for the performances alone. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/295136695228186624">my Lincoln Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> is the mostly fictional tale of the CIA’s hunt for Osama Bin Laden. The earlier acts are marred by their slow pacing, but it’s the final act that makes the movie: a half hour assault on a compound believed to contain their target. So clinical and relentless is the execution of this scene that it is absolutely gripping. Jessica Chastain puts in a great performance but is let down by the film’s pace and structure. Good, but not great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/297069577253302273">my Zero Dark Thirty Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>It’s a tough month, containing all the big Oscar contenders, but I think I’m going to go with <strong>Django Unchained</strong>. It’s got the performances and style to make for a classic.</p>

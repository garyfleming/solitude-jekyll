  <h3><a href="/Archives/2009/11/29/saving/">Saving</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Many financial experts will tell you that when you save for something that it should be goal-oriented i.e. that it should be for something in particular. There are a number of things in the course of, say, a year that are worth saving up for, where there are no pay-monthly options, or those options come with particularly punitive rates and fees (I’m thinking various forms of insurance, bills etc). There are also usually items that people actually want to save up for: new cars, new furniture, new televisions etc. Whatever they context, people often want to save amount X for item Y by date Z.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we’d all be excellent planners. We’d be able to set aside the right amount of money each month without any prompting, never dipping into it for other things unless absolutely necessary. In our far from ideal world, we’re not all great budgeters. People frequently pay for item Y from the last source of funds available to them before date Z.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that saving accounts could be a lot smarter in order to facilitate these kinds of transactions. For starters, let users deal with savings in the terms that they actually think. Rather than just being big pots that you move your money into, they should allow you to create many smaller but specific pots: one for each of the items that you are saving up for, with a label so you know exactly what it is for. The savings account should also let you specify how much is needed in each of these pots and the date by which you will need to have reached your goal. That means that at any point in time, you can then see exactly how close you are to achieving your goal.</p>

<p>Let’s go further: give the option of figuring out exactly how much you need to save for each item each month in order to reach your goal on time. Allow the user to automatically transfer that money in each month.</p>

<p>By modelling a savings account in the way that it would actually be used, you can facilitate much better user interaction. Rather than having to work out how close they are to a series of goals over a number of different dates, the account does the work for them. That’s a good thing.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2009/11/27/focus-attention/">Focus Attention</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Every Monday several online retailers that I’ve previously used tell me about their one-day only sales. That’s fine by itself, they can try and sell me things if they like; I can always ignore them or block them if I don’t like what I’m getting.</p>

<p>One of these retailers in particular used to be very focused. As I only ever bought gaming-related items from them, they would send me only gaming related materials. To me, that’s the right way of marketing your wares: have a think about what the user actually wants and see if you’re right. For a good while, they had my attention. Given the focus they had put on their emails, I’d usually go and look at the games they had on sale.</p>

<p>Lately, though, it’s been a lot less focused. When I click through onto their website, I no longer have the option of looking at just the items on sale that relate to my interests (in this case, the games on consoles I own). No, instead, they have all the items dumped into 30-odd item pages, with around 6 pages. To me, this is exactly the wrong way of marketing your wares: you’ve gotten my attention and then blown it by expecting me to scour through several pages worth of things I’m not interested in, for one or two things I may be interested in. I may see the first page, but it becomes increasingly unlikely I’ll go any deeper.</p>

<p>This is a pretty common problem: forcing users to do work to find the information they want. While you can prompt them to look at some things YOU want them to see, you can’t divert their focus from the things THEY want to see. Instead, as designers, we should be enabling them to find the things they want, to slice and dice their view of the data you’re handing them however they like. If that means categorisation, fine. If that means building a good search function, then do it.</p>

<p>Failure to focus attention is failure to design. If you haven’t done a good job of designing your information flow then users will begin to dislike your system without realising why. At that point, you’ve lost their attention.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2009/11/26/receipts/">Receipts</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It occurred to me a while ago while clearing out my wallet of annoying pieces of paper that, the vast majority of the time, receipts are largely unnecessary. Most of them you will never use, and either get binned or put into a filing system to never be seen again. The problem is, of course, you don’t know which ones you might need in the future. Will they already have that game you’re gifting? Will the new TV develop a fault? You just don’t know.</p>

<p>So, receipts: a necessary evil (and by “evil”, I clearly mean minor nuisance).</p>

<p>What can we do to improve receipts? First, if we must store them, then let’s make that more convenient i.e. let’s make the receipts digital. This could be relatively straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask the customer for an email address and send it to that,</li>
  <li>If they pay by credit card, store their email address against it for later use (if you’re worried about security, hash the credit card details),</li>
  <li>If they have a store loyalty card, then use the email address tied to that,</li>
  <li>If they don’t have one or don’t want an email, fallback to paper-based methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple. As an extra convenience, it might be worthwhile trying to get credit card providers to store a minimal amount of secure data on credit cards. This is definitely possible (though unlikely) and would ease the first-time pain.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we’re doing this electronically, I’d also consider providing a machine-readable version of the receipt; a standard way of marking up sales information. If that were to happen, then you can start to build tooling. You can do all sorts of deep interesting tracking if you have your financial information available electronically. If you imagine the sort of thing that Wesabe do just now, then you can start to see where we could go from there.</p>

<p>Are there issues? Yes, absolutely. If you want to return something, you need to be able to get your receipt (not strictly true, but that’s how you do it easily). In the digital world, that would either mean a print-off or, I imagine, getting the ID from the receipt. That ID should be sufficient to prove that you own a product and bought it in the shop you were in as all the transaction details should be available. The shop would need to rescind the receipt based on the ID to prevent multiple people trying to use the same receipt but that wouldn’t be very hard.</p>

<p>Another issue is that smaller shops would have an obvious overhead to pay. Well, there are two outcomes here: they can not participate (keep things the way they are, which is absolutely fine), or get someone else to run most of the system as a managed service. There’s actually really very little of this that would be shop-specific so it would be easily built and sold on.</p>

<p>That’s another worthwhile point: it could start a nice little niche business. People supplying these systems and building tooling around it.</p>

<p>Now, technically, my understanding is that receipts are not strictly necessary under UK law at all, but are a de facto part of how sales tend to work. To that end, I think that making them digital would be reasonably beneficial. Just an idea.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2009/11/22/always-a-story/">Always a Story</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>In a discussion recently, I realised why image galleries on websites make me uneasy (by image galleries, I mean software like <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/">Coppermine</a>, which is extremely polished). It’s not that I dislike the content, it’s often appropriate or useful. You often do need to see something, whether it’s a bunch of application screenshots or perhaps some pictures from a band’s latest tour. They have information to convey, and are worthwhile.</p>

<p>No, I finally realised that the issue I have with them is that they’re almost always completely hived off from the rest of the content. You have your all the interesting news on your site, you have the products you want to sell, you have your twitter account brought into the main site, but so often the image galleries are sat on their own. You’re either in the main site, or looking at the images, but never both.</p>

<p>Most websites are trying to tell a story of some sort. Bands are trying to communicate with fans, software houses are trying to showcase products, and bloggers are trying to put their own little view of the world forward (myself included). In order to tell a meaningful story, you have to realise that so much of the world and the way we perceive it is connected. You might have seen the latest tour news from some band you like, but you’re part of that story if you go see them, and the pictures of those shows are too.</p>

<p>By putting the galleries out on their own, they’re no longer in the same context as the rest of your story. They’re telling their own story. Sometimes that’s just fine, but more often than not they’d be better understood in a larger context.</p>

<p>It might just look like a bunch of gig pictures on their own, but have them tell the story of the particular gig they’re from, mix in your tweets from your fans, and any other media you can lay your hand on and you have a fair richer story. That’s much more compelling and interesting. You’ve gone from a bunch of discrete sources to a tapestry, something to build a legacy on.</p>

<p>Is it more work to tell a story than to put it into a gallery? Right now, probably, yeah. Is it worth it? Absolutely.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2009/11/22/functional-part-1-revelations/">Functional, Part 1: Revelations</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Since Java and the JVM are getting <a href="http://puredanger.com/tech/2009/11/18/closures-after-all/" title="Closures for Java">proper closure support</a>, now is as good a time as any for me to dump some thoughts about functional programming onto the site. I’ve got a few posts in mind, but I imagine this will be a somewhat sporadic series. Anyway…</p>

<p>When I was first introduced to functional programming, as part of my degree course, I didn’t really understand it. Not that I didn’t do well at the course, it was one of my strongest modules that year, but I really didn’t understand the benefits and potential. It did seem unusually neat, producing fairly compact code (we were taught Haskell, unsurprisingly), but also fairly burdensome. Avoiding side-effects and assignment was just too foreign, and I didn’t have enough real-world experience to really get the point. So, for a few years, I just forgot about it and got on with programming in other languages (Java, C, PHP, JS, etc).</p>

<p>Skip forward a few years, and as a reasonably experienced coder, I often found myself frustrated at the languages I was using. I would always try to make my code as neat and compact as I could, trying to minimise any wasteful re-use. If two classes were vaguely similar, then I’d look to find the common elements and make the differences abstract. Joel Spolsky talked about this <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html" title="Article on functional programming in Javascript.">when covering Javascript</a>.</p>

<p>That’s all well and good but without certain key language features you can only get so far. The very constructs that hold the language together (loops, ifs, locks etc) are often the part that are either impossible or very difficult to abstract. This revelation brought me back to functional programming.</p>

<p>I now realise that the core of functional programming is freeing yourself from the constraints of the language, using different higher-order functions to express yourself more clearly and succinctly. A necessary consequence of this is lack of side-effects, and that’s a GOOD thing.</p>

<p>Stick around, I’ll be covering a number of libraries and ideas that make life simpler for the functional programmer.</p>

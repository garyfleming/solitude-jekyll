## About

Rather than the old, and terrible, About section, here&#8217;s something more useful:

### About The Site: Purpose

The original purpose of Solitude was to provide a public space to toy with web design and new ideas while VKPS (the now defunct parent site) was being refitted. As Solitude grew to meet the requirements of VKPS, it took over and replaced it completely. Any plans to revive the main site are on indefinite hold. There are ideas, but I don&#8217;t have as much time as I&#8217;d like to be able to do it justice.

This site is about my views on whatever I feel like writing at the time. It was originally intended to be about technology and code, and there&#8217;s still a lot of that around, but most updates these days are about cinema simply because I like to track my viewing. I find it useful to have a record of the films I&#8217;ve seen and what I thought of them at the time.

### About The Site: Code

The site is powered by Jekyll. For most of its lifespan, until early 2016, it was powered by a fairly stock WordPress install. For the first 3 years of its existence, it used Finetto, a CMS I wrote myself in my younger and more naive days; it was and never will be released.

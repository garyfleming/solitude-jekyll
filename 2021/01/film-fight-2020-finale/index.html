<div class="post">
  <p>Film Fight, for the first time in years, ran roughly to schedule. Most of the monthly posts went up on time! Hurrah!</p>

<p>The downside is that the entire film release business was pretty hampered by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, with cinemas being shut for most of the year. Given this meant my attention was elsewhere and timeliness was less of an issue, I made a change to the rules: rather than only reviewing films I saw within roughly a month of their release, I’d review anything that came out in 2020, whenever I finally saw it.</p>

<p>As we go into 2021, I’ll start ageing out films from eligibility in some way or another, but it’s not like any of this particularly matters. The good films will still be good.</p>

<p>As per the <a href="https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/2020/01/film-fight-2019-finale/">caveat every year</a>, Film Fight is done in a (non particularly serious) knock-out style: it can pick my favourite film of the year, but nothing else. (Also the very idea of a single favourite film is a bit silly.)</p>

<p>First up, the honourable mentions: films that were good but didn’t win their month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jojo Rabbit</li>
  <li>Little Women</li>
  <li>The Lighthouse</li>
  <li>The Personal History of David Copperfield</li>
  <li>Horse Girl</li>
  <li>Freaks</li>
  <li>The Platform</li>
  <li>Vivarium</li>
  <li>Lost Girls</li>
  <li>Sweetheart</li>
  <li>Extraction</li>
  <li>Swallow</li>
  <li>Sea Fever</li>
  <li>The Lovebirds</li>
  <li>Ultras</li>
  <li>Da 5 Bloods</li>
  <li>The Banker</li>
  <li>Family Romance, LLC</li>
  <li>Palm Springs</li>
  <li>Nobody Knows I’m Here</li>
  <li>7500</li>
  <li>Days of the Bagnold Summer</li>
  <li>Tenet</li>
  <li>The King of Staten Island</li>
  <li>Greyhound</li>
  <li>Mank</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those are worth seeing, but worth pointing out <strong>Palm Springs</strong> and <strong>Tenet</strong> as the only two films from this year I’ve seen twice; and I’d happily watch either again immediately.</p>

<p>Now, the monthly winners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: <strong>Parasite</strong></li>
  <li>February: <strong>Uncut Gems</strong></li>
  <li>March: <strong>The Invisible Man</strong></li>
  <li>April: <strong>System Crasher</strong></li>
  <li>May: <strong>Uncorked</strong></li>
  <li>June: <strong>The Orphanage</strong></li>
  <li>July: <strong>The Assistant</strong></li>
  <li>August: <strong>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</strong></li>
  <li>September: <strong>Get Duked</strong></li>
  <li>October: <strong>The Trial of the Chicago 7</strong></li>
  <li>November: <strong>His House</strong></li>
  <li>December: <strong>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, the year was front heavy, but wasn’t followed up by many Summer blockbusters or late-year prestige dramas.</p>

<p>I remember how difficult <strong>System Crasher</strong> was to watch, but it’s incredibly powerful too. A system failing a young girl with serious issues. Seek it out.</p>

<p>Likewise, <strong>The Assistant</strong> is important but much quieter, showing how quietly and complacently people become part of a system that exists to harm others, backed up by an excellent lead.</p>

<p><strong>Uncut Gems</strong> is anxiety-ridden, tense, aggrevating, and absolutely gripping. It’s great to see Sandler back in a decent role, and the rest of the cast back him up. A stressful watch.</p>

<p>Finally, to a winner: it feels like a long time ago that I saw it, and definitely not like within the last year. I had wanted to rewatch <strong>Parasite</strong> before making a decision here but, honestly, it’s not much of a contest. There have been some incredible films over the last 12 months, despite the obvious challenges, but Parasite gets everything right. It’s beautiful, well-paced, surprising, and with a lot of depth. It seems like that rare film that almost everyone will get something from.</p>

  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>There are three ways to reasonably serve up <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>, listed here in order of preference:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">application/rss+xml</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">application/xml</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">text/xml</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Since the first is the type we say we’re serving in the link tag (despite that type not being a real MIME type), that is the one we should probably pick to serve our feeds as. The problem is that browsers (rightly) refuse to display <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/rss+xml</code>. Instead, they try to download it or pass it to another viewer.</p>

<p>This behaviour doesn’t help someone who doesn’t know what an RSS feed does (a problem that needs addressed). They will see something they do not understand being downloaded and abort. Not good. To aid in this, it would be nice for the user to see the styled feed (<a href="/Syndication/RSS.rss">my RSS 2.0 feed</a> already has <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> styling).</p>

<p>Two thoughts occurred to me: “Are there any workarounds?” and “How are others serving their RSS feeds?”.</p>

<p>Changing the content-type to <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/xml</code> fixes the visibility problem, but means that feeds are inconsistent with the link tag. In turn, changing the link tag to suit the new content-type isn’t feasible. There are dozens of aggregators who need to see <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/rss+xml</code> in the link tag to do auto-discovery properly.</p>

<p>Step 2 was to see how others serve their feeds. The results were disconcerting, at best. <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/index.shtml">Jacques Distler</a> and <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/">Anne van Kesteren</a> both use <code class="highlighter-rouge">text/xml</code>, <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a> uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/xml</code>, and <a href="http://intertwingly.net">Sam Ruby</a> uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/xml</code> for RSS 0.91 and <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/rss+xml</code> for RSS 2.0.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>In the end, it’s probably best to settle on the middle option: <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/xml</code>. Why? It provides visibility, is the parent of the “correct” MIME type (if you see these things as hierarchical), and it is a real MIME type.</p>

<p>The situation is hardly ideal, but it’s the one we have.</p>

<p>As an aside, <a href="/Syndication/">my RSS feeds</a> now have a new extension (.rss, rather than .xml). I’ll be doing a transparent redirect for now, in a month or so I’ll make it explicit, and a month after that I might remove the old style entirely. Please update your subscriptions now to avoid disappointment later.</p>

    <p>Forget the critical acclaim. Forget the well-known cast. Forget the music by Billy “I’m Deep” Corgan.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that <strong>Spun</strong> is dire, save one scene.</p>

<p>The cast are largely annoying, perhaps by design. However, it certainly doesn’t make them any more endearing or interesting to watch.</p>

<p>The most grating part of the film is the music, where horribly overt acoustic tunes abound. They detract from the film by being played along to driving sections, cutting the pace in exactly the wrong places.</p>

<p>If your idea of gritty realism (a phrase that is bound to appear in any review of the film) is anything with a low-grain camera, jaunty angles and some faux arthouse dialogue (in limited doses), then this might just appeal to you. To anyone expecting actual depth, go elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Given that their is a dearth of pictures of me on my site (with good reason), it’s with some trepidation that I link to a <a href="http://iratescotsman.com/images/phonepics/fri-28-11-2003/gary_gmm.jpg">photo of me asleep in a lecture</a>. I feel that it shows off my best features. The photo comes from <a href="http://iratescotsman.com">Matt</a>, who sneakily took it while I was in that particular pose.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/11/28/TheMedallion/">The Medallion</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I didn’t go to see <strong>The Medallion</strong> with particularly high hopes. I expected some typical <strong>Jackie Chan</strong> action, with some buddy comedy moments provided by <strong>Lee Evans</strong>. Mindless, enjoyable entertainment.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>It’s an absolutely dreadful film, to the extent that it’s quite amusing. It’s rare that a film manages to be so poorly done, so horribly cheesey, that it gets back to the funny stage.</p>

<p>Plot “twists” and occurences frequently appear from nowhere: the little boy suddenly gains the ability to travel between dimensions at the end of the film (which would have been handy when kidnapped by the evil doers), a plane suddenly appearing at Lee Evans’ house, Lee Evans’ wife having a huge weapons cache (we presume that she is some sort of secret agent, but it is never stated or hinted at), the fact that Jackie seems to be both invincible and immortal despite only having half of the medallion (despite being told something to the contrary in the film). There’s a lot more.</p>

<p>Poor acting, poor plot, no characterisation. All in all a humourously bad film.</p>

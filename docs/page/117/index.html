  <div class="post">
    <p>Forget the critical acclaim. Forget the well-known cast. Forget the music by Billy “I’m Deep” Corgan.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that <strong>Spun</strong> is dire, save one scene.</p>

<p>The cast are largely annoying, perhaps by design. However, it certainly doesn’t make them any more endearing or interesting to watch.</p>

<p>The most grating part of the film is the music, where horribly overt acoustic tunes abound. They detract from the film by being played along to driving sections, cutting the pace in exactly the wrong places.</p>

<p>If your idea of gritty realism (a phrase that is bound to appear in any review of the film) is anything with a low-grain camera, jaunty angles and some faux arthouse dialogue (in limited doses), then this might just appeal to you. To anyone expecting actual depth, go elsewhere.</p>

<p>A staccato review for a staccato film.</p>

    <p>Given that their is a dearth of pictures of me on my site (with good reason), it’s with some trepidation that I link to a <a href="http://iratescotsman.com/images/phonepics/fri-28-11-2003/gary_gmm.jpg">photo of me asleep in a lecture</a>. I feel that it shows off my best features. The photo comes from <a href="http://iratescotsman.com">Matt</a>, who sneakily took it while I was in that particular pose.</p>

  <h3><a href="/solitude-jekyll/Archives/2003/11/28/TheMedallion/">The Medallion</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I didn’t go to see <strong>The Medallion</strong> with particularly high hopes. I expected some typical <strong>Jackie Chan</strong> action, with some buddy comedy moments provided by <strong>Lee Evans</strong>. Mindless, enjoyable entertainment.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>It’s an absolutely dreadful film, to the extent that it’s quite amusing. It’s rare that a film manages to be so poorly done, so horribly cheesey, that it gets back to the funny stage.</p>

<p>Plot “twists” and occurences frequently appear from nowhere: the little boy suddenly gains the ability to travel between dimensions at the end of the film (which would have been handy when kidnapped by the evil doers), a plane suddenly appearing at Lee Evans’ house, Lee Evans’ wife having a huge weapons cache (we presume that she is some sort of secret agent, but it is never stated or hinted at), the fact that Jackie seems to be both invincible and immortal despite only having half of the medallion (despite being told something to the contrary in the film). There’s a lot more.</p>

<p>Poor acting, poor plot, no characterisation. All in all a humourously bad film.</p>

  <h3><a href="/solitude-jekyll/Archives/2003/11/27/FixedUgcRssFeeds/">Fixed Ugc Rss Feeds</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After the UGC recently changed their pages to a more irregular format (in terms of code), the <a href="/Code/UgcRss/">screen-scraped <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds</a> I made from them fell apart.</p>

<p>I finally got a chance to have a look at the code tonight and was terrified that it might be part of the main scraping that was going wrong (it’s fragile, very fragile), rather than the postprocessing.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the problem was that rather than leave directors and actor details blank (as previously) they now remove the line entirely. This actually reduces the amount of code I was using to parse out the details I didn’t want.</p>

<p>In short, there was a problem and I’ve now fixed it. Please resume enjoyment of the UGC RSS feeds as long as they last before breaking again (such is the perilous nature of screen scraping).</p>

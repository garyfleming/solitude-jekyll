  <div class="post">
    <p>Oh dear. It all went a bit wrong. <strong>House Of Flying Daggers</strong> could have been a great film. The premise (police hunting for the leader of a dissident sect) lends itself perfectly to be an impressive martial arts film with large and small scale battles between the two factions. Instead, the film focusses on the growing love between two characters on opposing sides.</p>

<p>The poor Romeo And Juliet plot is further let down by the twists: weak bluff after bluff after “Aha” after double bluff, not a single one enhancing the film at all.</p>

<p>The final act was particularly weak, with one of the two male characters being picked fairly arbitrarily as the villian and the plot meandering from there.</p>

<p>Dull, lengthy cinematics only gave way to one or two reasonable fight scenes. A shame.</p>

    <p>How have you improved the world this year? Consider for a moment your place in the world. You almost certainly consume resources, but do you give the same amount back? Are you <a href="/Archives/2004/12/26/EndOfYear2004PartOneApathy" title="A post about apathy towards other people">apathetic</a> to those around you?</p>

<p>Maybe. You don’t have to deal with other people to change the world, to improve it in some small way. However, if you’re not actively trying to make it better, it is likely that you are passively destroying it.</p>

<p>Again, think about how you contribute to communities and society as a whole. List five ways that <strong>you</strong> make the world a better place (and please, leave out narcissistic reasons, you are not inherently good). Just list five ways that we are better off for having you around. Can you honestly do it? Why not?</p>

<p>A whole new year is coming. Think about how you can resolve that situation. Figure out your talents and skills, decide on the little things that you can do to improve the world, and then do them. As a thought experiment, this is only a brief curio. Action is what is needed. Action.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p><strong>Garden State</strong> was surprising. Expecting a fairly lightweight comedy about a life going out of control, it was pleasant to actually be watching a film that was more than a passable script with some funny moments.</p>

<p>While the first few scenes are self-indulgent and overly sweet appetisers, the meat of the film is both tender and succulent. A boy, a girl, friends, and a trip home; it writes itself.</p>

<p>A plot synopsis does not do this film justice. See it. See it for the beautiful insight into a life that seems messed up enough to be real. See it for the old friends who seem to genuinely care beyond standard Hollywood “loyalty”. See it because it is genuinely funny. Just see it.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/12/26/EndOfYear2004PartOneApathy/">End Of Year 2004, Part One: Apathy</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Apathy is a way of life now. How many times have you walked past the homeless, begging for change, with a shirk and slight fleeting shame? Far too many, I’d wager. Would it have killed you to give them a small amount? Probably not.</p>

<p>Apathy is becoming more apparent to me. At this time of year, of celebrations and over-indulgence, we either keep ignoring our fellow man or through them scraps of kindness to sate our own guilt.</p>

<p>You don’t even have to show respect for someone worse off than yourself, just help someone. Suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give someone you see begging or selling the Big Issue the time of day and a small donation. Honestly, if you’re reading this you can probably spare a quid, can’t you?</li>
  <li>Buy a <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym> you have downloaded. Anything at all you do not own, but have a copy of. You’ve probably got dozens to pick from. Buy at least one.</li>
  <li>Someone in a shop give you particularly good service over the rather frantic festive period? Let them know. Write their company a letter applauding their efforts rather than letting it slide. You’ll guarantee yourself a similarly high level of service later and probably make someone smile.</li>
  <li>Smile! Smile at a random stranger on a bus. You’re only burning calories but smiles are infectious little buggers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that it is not likely anyone will do any of these things, but at least consider why you are not doing them or something similar. Why are you not looking out for everyone else? What does it say about you?</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/12/26/NapoleonDynamite/">Napoleon Dynamite</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It is not often that you leave a film unsure whether you liked what you saw or not. Generally you can tell by the amount of snoring or head-shaking at plot points that you do not like it. It was odd, then, that <strong>Napoleon Dynamite</strong> left a fairly empty feeling inside. It is funny, but also embarrasing.</p>

<p>The eponymous character is a loser, not the sort of loser who is just non-conformant like in so many US high school films, a genuinely odd loser. His family are stranger, and it can be very uncomfortable to watch them interact.</p>

<p>Just like the film, I’m not sure where to go with this. It’s odd, but not necessarily good or bad.</p>

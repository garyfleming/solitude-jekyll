    <p>We are sequel-rife this month, with three of the four films having a predecessor. More pertinently, it’s a good month for cinema.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost In The Shell 2</strong> is the sequel to the excellent look at the nature of human existence and consciousness, viewed from a future where the human body is no longer a necessary part of our lives. This time around Batou has become the main character, picking up an investigation into why a new line of cyborgs are murdering people and then trying to kill themselves. While this film is still quite insightful and asks a lot of questions of the viewer, it does it a lot more overtly than its predecessor, going directly to the issues rather than presenting scenarios in which they are explored. The reappearance of several old characters (one in particular) also just seems like pandering to the fans, and detracts from what is, on balance, a reasonable film.</p>

<p>Let me say now that I hated <strong>Saw</strong>. I wanted to like it, but the woeful acting (Cary Elwes, what happened?), blip cuts to ruin tension, and unshocking finale (I had seen Audition not long before-hand) were too much. It was with some surprise that I found <strong>Saw 2</strong> to be quite enjoyable. Sure, it’s a cheesey horror film, with some annoying looks at the Jigsaw killer’s motivations, but I found it unpleasant to watch in all the right places, squirming at some of the more fiendish plans that had been dreamt up. The ending was unexpectedly clever (well, part of it was, the other part was a non-event). Shame the tension was let out again by those bloody blipcuts.</p>

<p>I’m not the biggest fan of the Rolling Stones so I didn’t know anything about the back story of <strong>Stoned</strong>; a film about the downfall of Brian Jones, a founding member of the band. It’s quite an interesting tale (which I won’t ruin for you, if you are in the same position as I was), but quite depressing, seeming like rock star cliche all over the place. There are no shocks in this film, no great stand-out moments, but nothing particularly bad either. Fairly average.</p>

<p>If you’ve seen the first Transporter, you’ll be wondering why I went to see the sequel, <strong>Transporter 2</strong>. I was thinking the same. I have to say that, like Saw 2, it’s a sequel that in some ways overcame a poor predecessor. The choreography is outstanding, outlandish and over the top, just as all good fight scenes should be. Sure, Jason Statham is an atrocious actor, the plot is paper-thin and some of the lines are hilariously bad, but I enjoyed it as a light-hearted action film.</p>

<p>This month is very hard to pick a winner, but I’m going to go with <strong>Saw 2</strong>, largely because it beat expectations by a long way.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/11/20/OnNewPhones/">On New Phones</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve had a new phone for a month or so now (if you had my number, it hasn’t changed since my first mobile) and think I know it well enough to discuss it a little bit here. I’m only going to a touch on a couple of little things I like about the Nokia 6680 compared to my previous mobiles, as Russell Beattie has comprehensively covered the <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008503.html" title="the best Nokia 6680 software">best of the software</a> which ranges from instant messaging tools, to various emulators, to… well, pretty much anything.</p>

<p>First off, the UI is nice. This is the first phone I’ve had where it’s clear that at some point a designer has been asked to intervene in the software development. That’s certainly an improvement over my first phone, a Trium monstrosity, and even the Motorola phones I’ve had which, while reasonably intelligent, are a bit ugly. For extra prettiness, I have also installed the <a href="http://www.dakkustudios.co.uk/forum/themes.php">Mac OS X theme</a> which has better chrome and icons for all the basic features (and many of the esoteric ones).</p>

<p>Secondly, the screen is quite impressive. My last phone (excluding the cheap temporary Siemens effort I had after destroying said phone) had a good colour screen for when I got it. It was bright and warm, and was very functional. This screen puts it to shame, with great colour depth and a much higher number of pixels. It makes everything (games, videos etc) more enjoyable because of the sheer improvement in clarity.</p>

<p>Talking of games, it’s bizarre to be able to play real games on a mobile, rather than the cheap games I’ve had bundled with previous phones (Snake, box pushing etc). It has a Doom port, SNES emulators, Game Boy Colour emulators and more. Also, because it’s a Nokia phone (my first), I can play all those nasty ports that I’ve looked down on because my Motorola wasn’t supported.</p>

<p>Although this is probably true of all new phones, the ability to connect to other things is impressive in its simplicity; no messing around with settings, no slow net connections, everything just works. The accompanying software (Nokia PC Suite) is excellent, making synching via bluetooth painless. So long as I sit within 20 metres of my computer at some point during the day, everything gets backed up. It’s also an eye opener to see a phone that can do so much (again, compared to my previous phones). We’re at a stage where even if the mobile devices can’t do something (generally pretty rare for what I want done), they can easily connect to another device that can do it. A brave new world.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’m missing out more, but I think a lot of the other software points are covered in the article I linked to at the start. There’s also some relatively decent <a href="http://3lib.ukonline.co.uk/nonagss60.htm">freeware for the 6680</a>, which covers pretty much everything you’ll need.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>It occurred to me while I was trying to think of something to post that I never actually finished the Food series. Oops. To cause the title of the series to become more of a misnomer (let’s be honest, most of the stuff so far has been barely edible), I’m going to teach you all how to make a drink.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First get a bottle of Oasis (or similar) and drink it.</li>
  <li>Get a mug and a funnel.</li>
  <li>Scoop 3-4 spoonfuls of cofee into the mug, followed by the same amount of hot chocolate powder.</li>
  <li>Add 2 spoonfuls of sugar.</li>
  <li>Add 2 spoonfuls of black sugar.</li>
  <li>Add 2 spoonfuls of icing sugar.</li>
  <li>Got any more sugar? Add 2 spoonfuls.</li>
  <li>Half fill the mug with milk and half with water.</li>
  <li>Microwave for 70 seconds (microwave cuisine – king among cooking methods).</li>
  <li>Pour into Oasis bottle via funnel.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once cold, you’ll have a drink that not only tastes great but works as a great counter agent to sleep deprivation, elephant-grade sedatives and day long meetings. The last time I had this stuff I, literally, could not sit still.</p>

<p>P.S. Not recommended for diabetics or people who don’t want to develop diabetes.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>After the two previous posts about Notes, I was going to leave it alone. It’s an old version (R5) I’m using and it’s probably had enough. I even binned the list I had of 14-15 other things wrong with it. Today, though, I saw something that made me laugh.</p>

<p>Traditional web browsers can only download a regular percentage of a web page, generally with a maximum of 100% of a page being brought down; not so with Notes. Today it set a new record for downloading a percentage of a web page.</p>

<p>It got to 200% and I was impressed.</p>

<p>It jumped to 500% and I was astounded.</p>

<p>When it got to 11892% (that’s nearly twelve thousand percent) complete, I knew I had seen something truly amazing. Congrats, Notes, you did it!</p>

    <p><strong>A History Of Violence</strong> is quite unlike many recent films. It does not try to cleverly tie together a dozen plot strands. It does not mind if characters are their to serve a single purpose and then move on. It does not need order and tranquility to be restored to the smalltown world view it portrays early on. And it’s far better for it.</p>

<p>Cronenberg shows us a portrait of a man who has forgotten his past and does not like the blood it coats his life in. Tom Stall wants to disappear back into his new community, but his world has been changed irrevocably and his family have to deal with the consequences. Viggo Mortensen is tragic, and broken, as the main character; only occasionally allowing events to become a touch comic book. The ending makes this film though, with no forced resolution. Great film.</p>

<p>Next is <strong>Serenity</strong>, the film based on the ill-fated but absolutely brilliant Firefly tv series. What can be said about the film? It’s good, it has some excellent action sequences and character building, some truly shocking moments (particularly for Firefly fans), and pads out the universe quit nicely. It does, however, seem to miss the point entirely in several places.</p>

<p>I can understand that Mal, the captain of Serenity, has to come back to a level of decency after becoming so jaded in the war, but it seemed a bit much to have him and the crew cast as heroes; superheroes even. They were smugglers on the frontier, people trying to make ends meet anyway they could. They were not saving the galaxy. River seemed greatly under utilised. Yeah, she kicked ass, but I always expected more than just a killing machine (though it was obvious she was more than capable of the carnage she caused). Most disappointing were the Reavers. Although you never saw them directly in the series, they were portrayed as people who had gone mad and carnivorous living on the edge of civilization. This was brilliant, far better than any alien race that could have been conjured up. Sadly, they are tied neatly into the film in the most cringeworthy way.</p>

<p>It’s a good film, don’t get me wrong, but as a fan of the series I felt a little let down.</p>

<p>Some Russian cinema next in the form of <strong>Night Watch</strong>, the first in a trilogy of films about a centuries old war between light and dark and the coming of the prophets who will end it. Add vampires, werewolfs and all sorts of other stuff and you get the idea. Although something of the plot was lost in translation, the world in which the story is set is reasonably solid, with interesting intracicies and mechanisms underpinning the metaphysics. The Gloom in particular is an inspired idea. The low budget did show at times, constant cuts commencing any time anything happened in an action sequence, but it was a decent start if nothing else.</p>

<p>Bill Murray is becoming pretty good at the quiet, deadpan style of comedy these days. <strong>Broken Flowers</strong> continues this with the tale of a man tracking down old loves to find out who send him a message about his long lost son. Cue the inevitable journey of finding himself, taking in various oddballs along the way. Sure, it’s predictable and a little formulaic (in the off-beat mould), but it’s still entertaining. Again, it comes complete with a solid ending.</p>

<p>Finally, Tim Burton returns to animation with <strong>Corpse Bride</strong>. I have little to say about this film. It was mediocre in every way, from the story to the acting, both Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp putting in character performances that are beneath their ability. It does have good moments, but nothing outstanding.</p>

<p>The winner? Hard to say. The first four films here could all have won in previous months, but I think A History Of Violence wins it purely on how satisfying the ending was to watch.</p>

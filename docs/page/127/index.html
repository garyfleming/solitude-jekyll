    <p>You make a plan, a plan in your head, and assume that’s how things are going to happen. They won’t.</p>

<p>Maybe you thought you were going to the cinema for a movie and a quiet night, but somehow you end up with a group of friends you haven’t seen in a while, drinking and chatting until the quiet hours eventually arrive.</p>

<p>Maybe you thought you were going to see an old friend at a certain place at a certain time, but he doesn’t show up in the three hours you wait (with others).</p>

<p>Maybe you really thought you were finished, but you know you’re not.</p>

<p>Plans change, nothing is concrete, people are unpredictable. This is not a bad thing. Life should be about the unexpected.</p>

<p>Maybe you should plan for the unexpected, but you’re probably planning yourself into a corner.</p>

    <p>It’s always great when I can shape a random links post into some sort of tenacious collection. This time it’s language:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/256229.html">Scrambling Words</a></strong> – If you scramble letters in a word (leaving the first and last letter the same), you can still read sentences full of garbled text. An odd bit of pattern matching on behalf of the brain. Via <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/">Aquarionics</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.asksnoop.com/">The Shizzolator</a></strong> – Shizzles up any site. Not particularly effective on this site. However, a few random bits get through, making it funny enough.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/14/Read">Tim Bray has cracked</a></strong> – He’s suggesting that we use “read” and “readd” to tighten up the English language a bit. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.i18nguy.com/twain.html">Mark Twain’s improvements</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said, tenacious… That’s all for today.</p>

    <p>Time for another round of fighting with <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>, accessibility and the like.</p>

<p>First, I now provide a custom id on the root (<code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code>) rather than on the body, for those browsers that I send the site to as real XHTML (Opera, Mozilla, etc). Other browsers still get it on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code>.</p>

<p>Also, given the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/cgi-bin/mt/mezzo/archives/000259.asp">recent findings about screen readers</a>, I’ve changed my skiplink <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> as appropriate. I wanted to use <a href="http://blog.tom.me.uk/2003/09/13/skipadeedoodah.php">Tom Gilder’s skiplink method</a>, but it refused to work with my site. I’ve gone for a more basic version, and will come back to the problem at a later date.</p>

<p>Finally, one thing I’ve yet to implement is <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000218.html">marking up all instances of <code class="highlighter-rouge">acronyms</code></a>. Jacques is offering some excellent advice on that page that I intend to follow. But not yet, I’ve had enough of looking at code for one day.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/09/15/IsEchoAtomDead/">Is Echo/Atom Dead?</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I hate to say it (especially after putting in so much effort), but is the project codenamed Atom/Echo dead? Let’s look carefully:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">Echo wiki</a> is largely dead. A quick look at <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RecentChanges">the wiki’s recent changes</a> shows that work has definitely slowed right down.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/NameFinalVote">Name Voting</a> is an absolute mess. All of the originally cleared candidates have been voted out, the best names (Echo/Atom) have been deemed unviable, and the new names are… well, awful. Kitak, Mota, Syntia? Are we naming concept cars?</li>
  <li>Oh yeah, and the number of votes for each entry are very much single figures, which doesn’t look good for community adoption.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/maillist.html">Atom mailiing list</a> has plunged in usage. From around 30 entries a day at it’s peak to, at best, 5. Ouch.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://danja.typepad.com/fecho/">Formerly Echo blog</a> is pretty dead too. Updates are sparse and short.</li>
  <li>Very little mention of it in the places we used to see it mentioned at least twice a post.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this, we can say that work has definitely died down. But, that doesn’t quite paint a fair picture. Important avenues are being explored elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bitworking.org/rfc/draft-gregorio-07.html">Atom<acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym></a> is doing particularly well. Amongst others, a <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/PhpAtomApiImplementation"><acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> implementation of the API</a> is pretty much done, as well as PERL and Java versions. That’s a big step.</p>

<p>It’s tough to say. The forward motion we once saw has hit a wall. Hopefully, the apathy will clear up soon. We’ve all put in too much effort to let it die.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s been one of those fun days, but to save much moaning I’ll cut to the point: my mobile phone has died a horrible death and it’ll be a few days before I’ll be able to fix it or replace it. Fun. I know some people who actually know me read this, so consider this the best notice I can give for a few days.</p>

<p>In my infinite wisdom, I made sure not to keep a list of peoples numbers I had stored separate (on paper etc), so chances are I’ve lost 90% of the numbers I had. Joy.</p>

    <p>I’m going to be busy the next few days, so I’ll explain the lack of updates that will appear over the next month or so now: I’m moving to Nottingham.</p>

<p>I’m taking a year out of university to work for a BigCo who have offices in Nottingham. I don’t know anyone there, never lived on my own before, and can’t cook: should be interesting.</p>

<p>So, as of Thursday coming, updates will be sporadic at best until I can get a new computer down there. Stick around though, lots of good stuff planned.</p>

    <p>Apple have announced an interesting new product: the <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express</a>. It allows computers with wireless capability to stream music (via an iTunes variant) to remote base stations. These base stations are, in turn, connected to your hi-fi.</p>

<p>Now, while I like the idea and being able to listen to my music collection on my stereo would be fantastic, I’ve got one question: when I’m upstairs listening to music via said stereo, how do I control the base station?</p>

<p>It would be easy to create a remote control that told the base station to tell the computer to fast forward/rewind/pause etc. As far as I can tell though, there is no mention of such functionality. I see that as a fundamental flaw. Music with no control? Hmm. A pause button is a minimum requirement in my book.</p>

    <p>It’s been a struggle for the last few months, third year has seen many casualties, but it’s finally over. My last exam was yesterday and, for the first time since October, I can stop thinking about university. It is a <em>very</em> good feeling.</p>

<p>A few days of celebrations planned before updates here return to normal. Well, they will for about a week before the bigger news (and subsequent downtime around here).</p>

<p><ins><strong>Update</strong>: Ok, so apparently the year is actually 2004, and not 2005 as the title suggests. But I won’t have exams next year, so… quiet.</ins></p>

<p><ins><strong>Update 2</strong>:</ins> For anyone who is interested, <a href="http://www.chris-miller.org/">Chris</a> is hosting <a href="http://www.chris-miller.org/gallery/album16" title="Pictures from the 2004 3rd year Glasgow DCS students night out">pictures from the final day celebrations</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/06/01/filmdreams/">Film Dreams</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’m not normally one to post about stuff that has happened to me personally or to keep some kind of dream record but the sheer number and vividness of my dreams lately makes me want to quickly write about them. Interestingly, they all have one thing in common: they have films entwined in the plot.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you will, the basic plot of Flash Gordon (hero fights evil emperor, saves the girl, wins the day). Got it? Now set it in Glasgow, cast <a href="http://iratescotsman.com/">Matt</a> as Ming, myself as Flash, and have a getaway chase scene on go-karts through a palace that has appeared on Buchannan street. That is the kind of dream I’ve been having.</p>

<p>Another? A more literal re-telling: Having just come out of seeing Eddie Izzard perform, some friends and I get lost on the subway (which is no longer underground), ultimately ending up back at the same theatre. Rather than see the genius of Izzard again, we go into the bar. I start talking to Shaft (who is being played by Samuel L. Jackson in this dream) who is telling how tired he is, having not slept in several days. A call comes in over the radio: a local gang boss has been found. Shaft, who clearly isn’t going to take any crap from anyone, decides to round up a posse.</p>

<p>My friends and I decide that he probably needs some help and walk along the street. By the time we get along the road, he has amassed an army of angry young men with pieces. They began crossing town to go and get the gang boss. I take a motorcycle across town to arrive first, where we find a TV crew covering the whole thing.</p>

<p>The rest is slightly garbled: a chase through the villians mansion, down a secret passage and out into a street straight from the 1920’s. Two security guards grab him, and I go to put the cuffs on. At that he punches one in the throat and… my alarm goes off, ending the whole thing. Dammit.</p>

<p>Oh well, here’s hoping tonights doesn’t disappoint.</p>

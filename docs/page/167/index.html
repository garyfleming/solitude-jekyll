    <p>When I started making Finetto (the software that runs this site), I didn’t really plan it out very well. The design brief in my head was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> that doesn’t need database to work but allows information to be formatted in many different ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The obvious solution is to store content on the filing system in an <acronym title="eXtensible Mark-up Language">XML</acronym> format. This is still what I want to do (and have working fine). However, because of a lack of foresight, I didn’t really think about the potential bottlenecks and scaling problems involved in using the filing system. I just jumped straight into coding.</p>

<p>After a while, I knew that the initial idea would fail whenever I wanted to add new features. So I built a quick add-on system. It basically just loads in a whole bunch of functions and uses them when they’re called. But, again, I didn’t really plan it. And now I’m paying.</p>

<p>I realise now that more structured hierarchial data storage would work much more efficiently (I’ve tested it) and that an add-on model based around events allows more flexibility and hides the code from the end-user to a greater extent.</p>

<p>So, because I didn’t design it well in the first place, I’m having to retrofit huge amounts of code and come up with solutions on the fly. From here on out, I’m planning everything down to the last detail before starting anything. That way there’s no hassle.</p>

<p>On a side note though, the new add-on system and storage system (complete with funky caching) are quite advanced. Well worth the hassle to implement.</p>

    <p>For the first time in at least a year, it’s snowing here! There’s something inexplicably cool about snow (and no, I don’t just mean that it’s cold). Maybe it’s the crunching sound that fresh stuff makes under foot, maybe it’s the snowballs flying through the air, maybe… Maybe the cold has just gone to my head. I’ll try to get some pictures up later.</p>

    <p>I was looking through the referrer logs just a few minutes ago and found the most interesting entry: someone found me via Google by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=neds+noodles">searching for “neds” and “noodles”</a>. Bizarre.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t know my site had been indexed by Google at all.</p>

    <p>When someone first brought this to my attention, I thought it was a joke. It’s not.</p>

<p>Avril Lavigne (Queen of the posers) has covered a song by System Of A Down (Kings of modern metal). Yes, it’s as bad as it sounds.</p>

<p>I don’t want to scare people but here is the link <a href="http://www.crnw46307.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mp3/Avril_Lavigne-Chop_Suey_(System_Of_A_Down_Cover).mp3">Avril Lavigne – Chop Suey (Cover)</a>. I don’t know how long that link will stay up, so don’t hassle me if it stops working. Please exercise caution before listening – it will hurt.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/02/01/LackOfUpdates/">Lack Of Updates</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I haven’t been updating as much this week as I should be or have wanted to. It’s hard to discuss, comment or otherwise mention anything worthwhile when you’ve been having a pretty heavy week in the brain department.</p>

<p>First, the past week has been exam week at university. 3 maths exams, mostly difficult, at least partially my own fault. On the plus side, the three subjects I was sitting (Linear Algebra, Linear Modelling, and Graphs And Networks) are now over with. On the downside, I have another 3 courses starting on Monday – and that’s just maths.</p>

<p>Another major factor in the lack of updates is my <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>. I’ve been messing around – offline – with the way it stores and retrieves files. It’s got a few minor problems just now, but should be worked out soon (hopefully tonight). This might sound like a minor thing, but if I get it working the way I want it too it’ll fix the only major problem (scalability), allow posts to be found in different ways (by date, month, year among others) and generally just give me a few more toys to play with.</p>

<p>On a side note, I’m curious: what do people really want to see in a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>? I’ve developed this one almost entirely for myself, but what little features or major functions would you like to see? Send feedback to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#115;&#111;&#108;&#105;&#116;&#117;&#100;&#101;&#064;&#118;&#107;&#112;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#117;&#107;">my email address</a>.</p>

<p>The other thing that has been eating away at my time is <a href="http://www.challengetv.co.uk/ubb/Forum5/HTML/000059.html">Takeshi’s Castle</a>. Currently, it is showing on <a href="http://www.challengetv.co.uk/">Challenge TV</a> in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym>. Mad japanese people throw themselves through round after round of sheer torture. Highly amusing, for those who like to see people inflict pain on themselves via stupidity. The only question is: will anyone ever win? If so, what will they get?</p>

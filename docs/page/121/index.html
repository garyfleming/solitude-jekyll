    <p>Some were billing it as Macaulay Culkin’s comeback, it’s not that. Some said it was a work of comic genius, it’s not that. Some said… Let us just say that a lot of people have said a lot of things about <strong>Party Monster</strong>. I’m going to say very little more.</p>

<p>It’s not very good. By that I mean, and please excuse my use of our robust language here, it is utter shite. It’s written in such a way as to alienate the audience from the characters, making it rather difficult to care when things go wrong. Sure, there are some funny moments, but they’re only moments; seconds that die off as quickly as they arrived, leaving you just as cold to the characters.</p>

<p>I could say more, but I think everyone has said enough.</p>

    <p>It had to happen sometime. I knew that as soon as I heard about Atom that someone would inevitably get round to styling the bloody thing, forcing every alpha geek from here to xanadu to do the same (“but better”). It finally happened: <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1629.html">Sam Ruby is styling Atom</a>.</p>

<p>Not that it’s any harder than <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/ 04/27/SyndicationPlusStyle">styling <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym></a>. And not that I’m going to do it quite yet. I don’t think there is any demand yet for a stylised Atom feed. I’ll wait until nearer that time.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve always been a sucker for spoon-based games (especially the classic card game, Spoons). So when I read this I had to pass it on. From <a href="http://www.yeahbutisitart.com/000035.php">Yea, but is it art</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visit their home and then, when leaving, tell them that you’ve hidden a spoon somewhere in the flat and they have to find it. You could mention that there is a five pound note wrapped around it too… The missus’ pal then phoned up sounding rather angry and demanding to know where we’d hidden the spoon. Apparently she’d broken three nails and killed a plant which was uprooted from its pot in the quest to find the missing spoon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the whole thing, very funny and certainly worth trying.</p>

    <p>Yes, I finally got round to really updating the tech side of this site for the first time in ages. To aid accessibility, comment permalinks now have title attributes attached (not much, but it helps). For those occassions when standard acronyms are to be over-ridden, I’ve added the ability to switch off auto acronyms. Finally, I added a comment previewing feature (that should keep <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/index.shtml">Jacques</a> happy, at least). Go on, have a play with them.</p>

<p>I also got round to updating my foaf file. Expect that to change a bit more in the near future when I might get round to adding contacts to it.</p>

    <p>When I was born: breathing, squirming, crying, making noise, pooing.</p>

<p>When I was 5: starting primary school, Roland Rat, Mask, tab clear, blocks in the hole.</p>

<p>When I was 10: getting along, being the oldest in school, group politics (the effects of Ribena).</p>

<p>When I was 15: girls.</p>

<p>Today, I’m 20: my girlfriend, friends, university, enjoying life.</p>

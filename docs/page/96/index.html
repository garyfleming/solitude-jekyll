  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/08/12/spiderman2/">Spiderman 2</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The first <strong>Spiderman</strong> film was simple, bordering on dumb. Despite that, it had some beautifully realised scenes (the spider-sense being triggered in the school hallway). The sequel is slightly smarter, but not in terms of the plot.</p>

<p>The direction subtly parodies classic films like King Kong, Godzilla and Evil Dead (which is hardly coincidental) in the framing of Octavius as a misunderstood monster. It works well.</p>

<p>The plot itself is somewhat cringeworthy, staying very much on the surface of the story arc while setting up plotlines for the next inevitable installment, without really getting anywhere. A shame given the richness of the backstory.</p>

<p>A reasonable film, certainly improving upon its predecessor in terms of cinematics, if not story.</p>

  <p class="author">

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Another documentary from the now infamous director Michael Moore, <strong>Fahrenheit 9/11</strong> discusses American internal security issues after the twin tower incident several years back.</p>

<p>Despite being somewhat informative and, in places, frightening, the main points are made through conspiracy theory-like circumstantial evidence and conjecture. Certainly the points made stand up (why were the Saudis allowed to freely leave the country when no-one else could?) but the reasons given are based on relatively flimsy evidence.</p>

<p>The tone of the film is also more patronising than should be expected from a serious documentary, dumbing everything down to the point of childishness.</p>

<p>It still remains a watchable film, but not one to be taken as absolute truth.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/07/29/Shrek2/">Shrek 2</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>While many sequels of late regurgitate the original’s jokes but louder (see the Austin Powers sequels for a prime example), <strong>Shrek 2</strong> is original and funny. Taking place not too long after the first film, the story doesn’t feel like a contrivance to get the characters back together for another adventure; a logical extension, rather than an embarrasingly tied together mess.</p>

<p>That’s enough analysis though. Primarily this is just a fun film to watch, with charm oozing from every perfectly thought out detail (the BK and Starbucks in Faraway land). The parodies and jokes are aimed at all levels, the “Cops” scene being particularly memorable.</p>

<p>All in all, a great film, only hampered by the slightly slow middle. Certainly one to see (like anyone won’t have by now).</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/07/16/TheLadykillers/">The Ladykillers</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>While lacking the usual charm and oddities that are hallmarks of the Coen brother’s output, this remake of the classic <strong>The Ladykillers</strong> still retains their unique influence. Beginning with some beautiful shots of the settings, this film shows more of the pairs artistic flair than previous (less mainstream) efforts.</p>

<p>Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the odd Professor with the plan to rob a casino, while the supporting actors do an admirable job in the face of his scene-stealing performances. Hanks reels off pages of dialogue, intoned perfectly, without a hint of pausing. Impressive stuff.</p>

<p>The film itself is enjoyable as a lightweight comedy, but lacks the laughs of “The Big Lebowski” or “Fargo”. Although they should be proud of themselves, remaking such a well-loved film and doing a good job of it is admirable, you can’t help but miss the strange outpourings of the Coen’s original works.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/07/14/TheCooler/">The Cooler</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>There’s something about William H. Macy: he plays losers better than anyone else. Hopefully that’s a compliment to his fine acting ability.</p>

<p>In <strong>The Cooler</strong> he plays a gambler who loses so much he is hired to stand next to winners in a casino, causing them to dry up. His plan to leave this lifestyle is complicated by the appearance of a love interest and the usual Hollywood conceits.</p>

<p>Although well acted, there’s nothing particularly new about this film. It’s certainly not dull but it is predictable, even the slowest among us should be able to see the twists coming as soon as they are set up.</p>

<p>So, enjoyable but entirely forgettable.</p>

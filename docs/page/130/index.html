    <p>With a title like <strong><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0329101/">Freddy Vs Jason</a></strong>, it was never going to be a classic. As should be expected, the acting is awful and the premise is weak at best. You can pretty much guess everything else about it.</p>

<p>To be honest, though, I’m not entirely sure how much I disliked this film (I did dislike it though). I had such low expectations of it that it easily managed to surpass them; being watchable even if mostly terrible. So, while it’s about as scary as a kitten in a cotton wool jacket, it’s not as bad as you might think. Go see it? Still no.</p>

    <p>A long time ago, <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/05/11/TheXPhiles">I joined the X-Philes</a>. I promptly forgot about it, since everything was working well. Recently, I came across another website dicussing various matters about <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and markup: <a href="http://www.annevankesteren.nl/weblog/">Anne van Kesteren</a>.</p>

<p>Among other things, I learned that I could improve my content negotiation. Thanks to <a href="http://www.stijlstek.nl/ampersand/">Ben</a> for providing the correct user agents, I’m now one step closer to perfection.</p>

<p><ins>Update: Because I never really bothered checking old entries before the mime type switch in May, there were a few broken archive pages. That won’t stand. I went through the entire archive and fixed the few entries that didn’t work. One step closer…</ins></p>

<p>Next step: using an xml stylesheet processing instruction. (Yawn).</p>

    <p>I tweaked my <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/UgcRss/">UGC <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed creator</a> to include a few cinemas that I apparently missed. It should now cover every UGC cinema in the UK and Ireland. While I was at it, I also added information about the director and actors in each film to the description (if you want a plot synopsis, just follow the link on each item).</p>

<p>I also was about to change the mime-type from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text/xml</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application/rss+xml</code>, but to do that I’d need to generate a link to the feed, rather than take the user straight to the feed. This is, of course, pretty easy to do. Unfortunately, I’m knee deep in coding something else, so it’ll have to wait.</p>

    <p>The thing about most polished twisting films is that the twists have become far too cliched. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0310910/"><strong>Confidence</strong></a>, starring Ed Burns and Rachel Weisz, is one such film.</p>

<p>The plot isn’t important here, it’s more the predictability that should be focused on. If you’ve seen a few films like this, you’ll know what to expect. Con artist gets himself into a jam, gets himself out of jam (almost), things seem to go horribly wrong, it was all part of the real plan that’s been hinted at all along. Yawn! By now, we all know that “throwaway” dialogue in these films is usually an indication that something important is going on. Same with various framing techniques. If you ever see an actor giving an over the shoulder look, think carefully about what’s going on.</p>

<p>So, maybe doing some media studies ruined this film for me, maybe it just wasn’t a great film. Either way, I’m sick of seeing predictable twists. Get some real imagination, Hollywood; surprise us all.</p>

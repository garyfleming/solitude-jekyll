  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/12/26/PolitenessAndAgents/">Politeness And Agents</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Politeness has long been a problem for automated agents on the web. Well, it’s not so much that politeness is a problem; agents are programmed to be impolite, whether accidently or not. Politeness is a solved problem.</p>

<p>Let us be clear on what is meant. “Agents” refers to any automated system capable of talking to web servers, i.e. search engines, aggregators, download managers etc. “Polite” means waiting a while before checking a server again.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a download manager hammers a file on my site 50 times a minute unsuccessfully, that’s impolite,</li>
  <li>If a search agent crawls my entire site, doing so again 4 hours later is impolite. Doing so again <em>every</em> 4 hours is downright rude,</li>
  <li>If an aggregator agent checks my <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds more than 3 times an hour, that’s impolite.</li>
</ol>

<p>How can we solve these problems? As was said earlier, politeness is a solved problem.</p>

<p>However, the <strong>current solutions are poor</strong>. In all 3 situations above, the user of these agents would be banned from crawling the site (either automatically or after manual inspection of logs). “Good riddance,” you might be thinking, “no good bandwidth leech, I’m better of without them.”</p>

<p>Have you considered that the user doesn’t know any better? They don’t know they’re being impolite because so few tools actually <em>tell</em> them.</p>

<p>Download managers: they’ll let you pick any number of connections and any time interval between retries. Would it kill the implementer to bring up a dialogue saying: “This could cause a heavy load on a server, causing you to be banned. Are you sure you want to change settings?”</p>

<p>Search agents: Is it so hard to say: “The time interval you’ve specified between crawls is impolite, and may get you banned and blacklisted. Are you sure you want to keep new settings?”</p>

<p>Aggregator agents: A similar time interval warning to search agents would suffice. As an aside, there is a mechanism in RSS that allows the producer of the feed to <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/">specify a recommended time interval</a> between checks. Do any aggregators support it? Do they tell the end user if they’re in breach of it? Hmmm? Thought not.</p>

<p>If a user doesn’t heed the warnings, ban them.</p>

<p>This puts the pressure on the tool makers to tell users of bad behaviour. And why shouldn’t it be? They should keep their users informed; it’s only polite.</p>

    <p>There are 2 hours or so until Christmas, so I thought I’d better say Merry Christmas to everyone who has ever read this site, to everyone who has left a comment (from some of the comments, it’s apparent that there are people who comment without reading), to all of my friends and family, and those that matter most to me: Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>As a bonus, have fun with this fun <a href="http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/">Make A Snowflake</a> game. There are some jaw-dropping designs in the gallery.</p>

<p><ins>Update: Thanks to the mighty <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>, you can <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=Merry+Christmas">feel the christmas spirit</a> on a bunch of sites you’ve never been to.</ins></p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/12/23/swat/">SWAT</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s been a while since I left the cinema quite so happy. It wasn’t because <strong>SWAT</strong> is a good, well-written film. Quite the opposite.</p>

<p>It is utterly terrible; bad in so many ways as to be hilariously good.</p>

<p>No-one will ever beat the character names in this film: Jim Street, the top swat member who gets kicked off the team following an incident with his risk taking partner, Gamble. He’s later recruited to a new “ass-kicking” swat team by Hondo Harrelson, along with other fantastically monikered characters such as TJ McCabe and Sanchez (the latino).</p>

<p>The dialogue is straight out of an episode of McGarnacle (the fictional show in The Simpsons), with a plot and stereotyping to match; with classic lines like, “You feel me, chief”.</p>

<p>I loved every cheesey, pathetic minute of it.</p>

    <p>Since I’ve been unable to update this week, the random links have amassed into a <strong>huge</strong> pile. To make sure you’re not completely overwhelmed by them (there are around 30), I’ll prune them a bit and split it into two posts. The other half should be out either tomorrow morning or Monday night. Onwards:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.miniclip.com/snowfight.htm">Snowfight 3D</a></strong> – Following on from the classic Starcraft clone, Snowfight, comes the 3D version. Requires Shockwave, but damn good,</li>

Only 13 months until HR8832 enters my lightcone and I can be blamed for stuff over there,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.esws2004.org/">Non-Semantic Semantics</a></strong> – In a genuinely ironic move, the European Semantic Web Symposium’s website is pretty far from semantic. It uses tables for layout and, painfully, uses images instead of text for <strong>every</strong> single word. Via <a href="http://www.zeldman.com">Zeldman</a>,</li>

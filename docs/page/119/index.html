    <p>It has been brought to my attention that the <a href="/Code/UgcRss/">UGC <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds are broken</a>. Unfortunately, I won’t have any time to fix it until next week at the earliest. Sorry for any inconvenience caused, I’ll get on it as soon as I can.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Up until relatively recently, I didn’t think I had a strong mental block (except whilst sitting in exam rooms). As can be inferred, it turns out I do.</p>

<p>For me, it is absolutely bizarre and foreign. Not being able to think about something (for whatever reason) is just so very odd. You start vaguely thinking about the subject and forming questions, but before they get anywhere it’s all gone. Nothing quite like it.</p>

<p>It irritates and interests me. Thinking about it clearly doesn’t help (and neither does not thinking about it). What can one do?</p>

    <p>There is a hill.</p>

<p>To most people, I imagine it is exactly that; just another hill that they pass every day. I, however, am fascinated by it.</p>

<p>Every curve is perfectly rounded, flowing into the next as easily as it slid out of the last. Each concavity reveals itself as a product of angle, increasing shade once approaching, disappearing as one passes. The lines are beautifully bezier; elegant yet simple.</p>

<p>In summer, before the harvest, long wheat blows out a wonderfully dynamic representation of the underlying hill; billowing those curves as sails.</p>

<p>In winter, after the harvest, short grass grows back, shivering back and forth as the cold wind pushes against it. Resolute, it stands.</p>

<p>I’ve never stood on the hill. In truth, I see it for 20 seconds a day, at most, yet still I admire it. Nature is a remarkable thing.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>For various reasons, I’ve outgrown <a href="http://www.methodize.org/nntprss/">nntprss</a> as my default <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> client (not least because it is sadly lacking in features due to the lapse in releases). So, I recently switched to <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">SharpReader</a>.</p>

<p>I had my first realy “holy shit, that’s cool” moment with it a few minutes ago. When subscribing to Stuart Langridge’s feed for <a href="http://kryogenix.org">Kryogenix</a>, I decided to look at a few of the recent posts. SortTable is one item I posted about recently (and is still in my RSS feed).</p>

<p>I was shocked to see, that in the item for his feed, the full text from my piece referring to his. SharpReader knew they were connected and did some implicit comment magic. Very nice.</p>

<p>Sorry for the geeky gush, but it took my by surprise, and I like that.</p>

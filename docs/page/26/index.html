  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/06/01/film-fight-2011-may/">Film Fight 2011: May</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>

  <div class="post">
    <p>May was a decent month for cinema, with four films viewed…</p>

<p><strong>Thor</strong> is not going to cause any great surprises: it’s a big budget, superhero-filled, special-effects-laden barrel of dumb fun; and fun it is. While a lot of films in this genre seem to think that just having enough explosions makes them worth seeing, Thor at least tries to build a story (and something of a mythos), and creates somes decent characters along the way. While Thor’s change of heart is as sudden as it is predictable, the supporting cast (particularly Loki and Odin) do enough to keep you distracted and the action moving forward. It’s worth seeing, even if it is as cheesy as you expect. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/67239767502360577">my Thor Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>13 Assassins</strong> is the story of the last days of the samurai. The 12 best (and one other character) are charged with assassinating an evil feudal lord, knowing it will likely be their last act. From end to end, the film is excellent: we get some clear and utterly brutal reasons why the feudal lord must go, and an hour or so of strategic manoeuvring and character building to set-up the last act. What a last act it is: a 50 minute battle where the 13 take on 200 soldiers with every trick they’ve learned. It’s a spectacular fight scene, that manages to keep up the momentum throughout. An excellent film. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/67240246881951744">my 13 Assassins Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Attack the Block</strong> is an interesting debut by Joe Cornish (of Adam &amp; Joe fame): while it’s clearly been shot on a low budget, this sci-fi comedy manages to turn this to its advantage, with monsters that are more frightening due to how difficult they are to see (they’re deepest black, except for their day-glo fangs). It manages to provide some good laughs, and reasonable horror moments, and in doing so is probably a success. It’s not fantastic, but is worth seeing. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/69852629827727360">my Attack the Block Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Win Win</strong> is most of what you expect from an indie film starring Paul Giamatti: the characters are likeable, but flawed; people learn important life lessons; and there is an underlying quirky wit to it. The story itself, that of a family that take in a teenage runaway who just so happens to be the wrestling champion that the father badly needs for his team, is pretty good, and you’ll feel for most of the characters along the way. This is a solid film, but not a stand-out. (see <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/72332651498979330">my Win Win Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for May is <strong>13 Assassins</strong>, for it’s excellent pacing and that finale. Excellent.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/05/29/film-fight-2011-april/">Film Fight 2011: April</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>April was a reasonable enough month, with 4 films in the fight.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Source Code</strong> manages to find quite a neat balance between a techno-thriller and decent characterisation. Unlike most entries to the genre, it tries to stay jargon light and stay focussed on the plot at hand: a bomb went off earlier in the day and, while that cannot change, through some advanced technology, a former-soldier is forced to relieve the event again and again in order to find clues to stop a future attack. It’s to Jake Gyllenhaal and Vera Farmiga’s credit that you actually end up caring about this “virtual” environment as much as they do, buying into the hopeless exercise. It’s somewhat marred by an overly saccharine ending, but the tight runtime keeps everything going at a good pace. Worth seeing.(See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/56437150803169280">my Source Code Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Your Highness</strong> is a silly and ridiculous film that takes the usually stoic and noble concepts found in most fantasy films, and turns them into a run of toilet humour. It’s not high-brow in the slightest, but it manages to get just enough out of the jokes to keep funny. It starts to wear more than a little thin by the end, but stops before there’s nothing left. It’s certainly not a classic, but there are enough absurd moments (the mechanical bird) for it to be somewhat memorable. Good, not great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/59233394965483520">my Your Highness Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Scream 4</strong> manages to do something that should not have been possible after Scream 3: it squanders the franchise even further, gaining absolutely nothing along the way. The handful of decent scares and laughs are entirely mired by the huge number of predictable twists and dull moments. The new characters are all forgettable, and the returning cast are either in it for the money, or left as paper-thin caricatures. Bad. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/62226627198849024">my Scream 4 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Cedar Rapids</strong> is an indie comedy that, while not a classic, is a surprisingly good film. Introducing Ed Helms as a painfully naive insurance salesman really slows down the movies opening (but does set up some awkward moments with his ex-teacher/lover), but the movie eventually finds some great moments for its characters to come alive. John C Reilly is excellent as an obnoxious, loud-mouthed competitor, with a good heart; being crude enough to be funny, but not so much that he’s repulsive. Well worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/64641538071859201">my Cedar Rapids Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>It’s another slightly tough month, but the winner is <strong>Source Code</strong>. The ending aside, it does a great job of making you sympathise with the lead and makes you want him to be able to change the unchangeable.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/04/03/film-fight-2011-march/">Film Fight 2011: March</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>March was an okay month, with 5 films in the running.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Drive Angry</strong> is a unabashed throwback to a time when action ruled all. If you’re looking for a film that has great lines, a sharp plot, or makes much sense at all, then you’re looking at the wrong film. Essentially, the film is about getting Nicholas Cage to play an action star again, with William Fichtner as a crazy demonic accountant-sidekick. It’s at its best when the action sequences are let go mad, and its worst when someone tries to shoehorn in a plot. It’s pure grindhouse, with all the good and bad that implies. Entertaining, despite being a bit terrible. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/44043660504993792">my Drive Angry Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Rango</strong> is one of the more interesting animated movies of recent times. What’s most striking about it are the visuals: this does not have the super-cute characters with oversized features you’ll find in most Pixar films. No, all the inhabitants of Dirt, the old western town it’s set in, are hideous little animals savaged by scars and warts. They bristle with character from the moment they appear, and set an interesting tone. Despite some risque lines here and there, it’s a fairly well-natured film about belonging, finding a place in the world and becoming a hero by being yourself. The plot won’t surprise, but it doesn’t have to when the rest of the package is so pleasant. Pretty good. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/46990115414867968">my Rango Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>There have been many books and films about alien invasions, many are better than <strong>Battle: Los Angeles</strong>, some are worse. When it’s trying to build B-plots of past tension between the characters, you simply will not care. None of them are interesting enough, or well-portrayed enough, to warrant any attention. Where they are a little better is in the action sequences. The camera work here will put some off, falling somewhere between the Bourne Ultimatum (very shaky) and District 9 (pretty watchable) in the handicam-shake stakes. If you can follow it, there are some pretty great set-pieces, with some reasonably well done CG. It’s entertaining, but not good. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/46990316582092800">my Battle Los Angeles Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Company Men</strong> is a little bit baffling. The economic downturn over the last few years is surely ripe for storytelling about families who are suffering the consequences, from professionals through the working classes. That’s not really what we get here: we get one company executive who is saddened by another, but lands just fine, and a reasonably well-off salesman who deludes himself for a while and then lands just fine. The film also fails to see any irony in a millionaire actor, playing a millionaire CEO, complaining about how the now derelict shipyards used to have good honest, hard-workers in it. Despite a pretty great cast, the performances are phoned-in in many places, probably because the characters are so utterly flat. It’s hard to care when no-one else does. A wasted opportunity. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/48445315015122944">my The Company Men Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Submarine</strong> is a distinctly indie debut from Richard Ayoade. It’s difficult to say what it’s about in a way that really captures the feel of the film. It has themes that are familiar, about love, loss, regret and making do, but doesn’t necessarily pursue them breathlessly. The fairly unlikeable lead (a self-obsessed teenager) lets his view of himself get in the way of being a decent human being. There are a number of other tangental threads that all connect in some way (his parents, a psychic, a bulled girl at school), but it’s not particularly tightly plotted, nor does it need to be. It did feel a little long, but there are enough amusing moments along the way to ease the rough pacing. Interesting. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/49908088098131969">my Submarine Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A difficult one this month: two entertaining action films, a cartoon comedy, a bland downturn tale, and a rough but interesting indie film. To my own surprise, I think I’m going to go with <strong>Submarine</strong> at the winner. While many of the films were good, I think this is the one I’d choose to watch again now.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/03/29/jpa-and-bad-assumptions/">JPA and Bad Assumptions</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I made a bad assumption about how JPA (with Hibernate) works a while ago, that came back to bite me recently. For a long time, I’d assumed that if you have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">@Column</code> annotation with a name attribute, that name would always be the name that gets used to match the field to a DB column i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">@Column(name="someName")</code> would always resolve to the DB column “someName”.</p>

<p>I was very much mistaken in that assumption.</p>

<p>When using Hibernate (and possibly other JPA implementations, I’ll need to check), it turns out that name just replaces the field name as it goes through the normal renaming process. That is, the name is still subject to all of Hibernate’s naming strategy code.</p>

<p>By default, that means that when using the ImprovedNamingStrategy (as most people are), “someName” becomes “some_name”. This is definitely a more db-like name, but took me a little by surprise when I saw this happening in someone’s code.</p>

<p>The lesson: never assume anything.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/03/17/film-fight-2011-february/">Film Fight 2011: February</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A relatively light February, with only two movies.</p>

<p><strong>The Fighter</strong>, in many ways, is a film you’ve seen before. It’s underdog story about a boxer who gets beaten and eventually, with the love of a good woman, finds his way to glory isn’t particularly novel or surprising. No, what makes it stand out is the quality of the performances from the entire cast. Christian Bale as the titular character’s drug addict brother/trainer is outstanding. Seeing through every twitch and failing, he really makes the character stand out without seeming ridiculous, fully deserving his Oscar. Both Amy Adams and Melissa Leo put in outstanding performances (the later also Oscar-winning), as they tear at what they feel is best for the lead. You’ve seen the story before, sure, but never quite this well done. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/36863067811745792">my The Fighter Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Paul</strong> sees Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up with a CG alien (Seth Rogen) for a fun, if gentle, Saturday afternoon comedy. There are a lot of nice little nods for the sci-fi geeks out there, and some funny moments, but we’re not talking about a classic here. It’s got a good feel, and you could certainly watch a lot worse, but not even the surprise cameos can turn around the fact that this is a little better than average. Fun, but not fantastic. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/41871971675414528">my Paul Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>As I’m sure you’ve guessed, <strong>The Fighter</strong> is the film fight winner for February.</p>

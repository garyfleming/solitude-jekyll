  <div class="post">
    <p>Roughly a year ago, I wrote a piece called <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2006/06/18/UbuntuAndStorage/">Ubuntu and Storage</a> about my ideas for both upgrading to Ubuntu (from Windows, it is an upgrade) and setting up a better storage solution. Iâ€™m going to focus on the latter part here.</p>

<p>I have data that I never want to lose or have to recreate: photos, music, documents, and a wealth of other stuff. I’ve considered backing up to DVD but I’ve had so many back experiences with them (another CRC error, you say?), that it’s not an option. Instead a RAID array seemed like the obvious choice.</p>

<p>If you want a decent personal NAS solution, all roads lead to the <a href="http://infrant.com/products/products_details.php?name=ReadyNAS%20NVPlus">Infrant NV+</a>. It’s quiet, powerful, and has excellent RAID options. The proprietary X-RAID option gives hot-swapping and hot-expansion of the disk array, and provides single-disk failure at the cost of just one disk.</p>

<p>So if you start with 2 * 500Gb drives (as I did), you get 500Gb of effective storage and it doesn’t matter if one drive blows up. Want more room? Shove in another 500Gb drive without switching off, or any downtime for the array to rebuild, and it still doesn’t matter if one of them blows up. Upgrade the size of the drives one at a time, and you don’t have to rebuild the array from a remote source.</p>

<p>Other interesting features they keep quiet include the DAAP server (for iTunes compatible streaming music), the UPnP server (for different av streams), the rsync server (for anything else) and one-button backups to attachable storage.</p>

<p>My only grumbles are the NFS transfer speeds are a little low (being worked on, apparently), and no shell access (if I could put a torrent client on there, I’d be very happy).</p>

<p>All in all, a great piece of kit.</p>

    <p>Roughly a year ago, I wrote a piece called <a href="/Archives/2006/06/18/UbuntuAndStorage/">Ubuntu and Storage</a> about my ideas for both upgrading to Ubuntu (from Windows, it is an upgrade) and setting up a better storage solution. I’m going to focus on the former part here.</p>

<p>It was probably a year and a bit ago, before Ubuntu really started kicking off, that <a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/">Stuart Langridge</a> recommended it to me. After a quick browse I was sold, and got the live CD. Problems quickly arose.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I had was the perennial problem for former Windows users: wireless networking. My wireless card just wouldn’t work, and no amount of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ndiswrapper</code> was fixing it. I did briefly consider writing a device driver, but I thought that if I don’t have time to keep this site as up-to-date as I’d like, then maybe that was a tad ambitious. Instead I got a new wireless card that had a manufacturers driver… which didn’t work. Bollocks.</p>

<p>That set me back a good few months. Sadly, in my old flat, the router was too far for a wired connection, and couldn’t be moved to a more convenient location. I got round this inconvenience by moving flat and using good ol’ ethernet. Sometimes we use a sledgehammer on a nut because it’s so much more satisfying than a nutcracker, or repeatedly smashing our head against the wall that is wireless support.</p>

<p>That gripe aside, it’s mostly good. <a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/">Beryl</a> is impressive (though mostly just eye candy), and package management is just amazing. Having absolutely everything on the system update automatically, safely and uniformly is just how it should work. The individual updaters on Windows seem positively prehistoric in comparison.</p>

<p>One last complaint though: why the hell does everyone love <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a>. It’s feature-rich, sure, but it looks and behaves like an absolute dog. Want to go randomly through your music collection? You don’t want collection, you want a playlist. The play/pause/forward controls? Tiny and relegated to the middle of the bottom edge. Have the designers never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts'_law">Fitt’s Law</a>? Though I used to be a big <a href="/Archives/2003/10/22/iTunesVsWinamp5/">proponent of WinAmp</a>, I prefer iTunes now and nothing on Linux comes close.</p>

    <p>This is, according to WordPress, the 600th post I’ve made since I started Solitude way back in January 2003. A lot of time has passed, lot of changes, and lot of silly things said (as well as the odd gem). I did consider going back through the entire archive and pointing out all the places I disagree with myself, but I figure that could take a while.</p>

<p>No grand promises about posting more, or better, or anything like that; just a marker to say we’re still going.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Things have been quiet here for the last few months for a number of reasons: moving flat, getting internet back, changing jobs (within the same company), and a bunch of other reasons (some of which I’ll be mentioning soon).</p>

<p>One of the big reasons for a slowdown in the number of posts is that I’ve been unhappy with my current content management system, Finetto, for quite some time. It was designed with a fairly limited amount of functionality in mind, primarily to help out a friend who needed a CMS quickly. It was also one of the first big PHP projects I had undertaken, before I really understood the language, and while I was still quite fresh to real programming (I have been programming since I was about 8 but not in a consistent and structured way). The design quickly became messy as more features were required. I could go back and rewrite the whole thing, with some interesting ideas, or I could just enhance an existing product.</p>

<p>In the last month or so, I’ve taken the time to pull data out of the old CMS and migrate it to everyone’s favourite CMS, <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I’ve been talking about doing this for a while, and one of my long stated goals for any such transition is that it would be functionally seamless for end users. Since I actually switched a few weeks ago and no-one seems to have noticed, I’ll call that one a success. As an aside, the recent <a href="/Archives/2007/05/20/feed-problems/">feed problems</a> were not related to the WP switch.</p>

<p>The switch itself was pretty painless. WP is easy to set-up, the design I used on the old CMS was easy enough to convert (using standards-based design helps), and the data was easy enough to migrate on the WP side. The only trick was actually pulling the data out of the old CMS. While it’s file-system based storage was exceptionally quick, it wasn’t the easiest to manipulate.</p>

<p>Expect some WP plugins to appear soon.</p>

    <p>Apologies for any recent feed problems you’ve been experiencing. As part of an effort to try and consolidate all my feeds (about 6), I’ve decided to outsource the URL to something a bit more permanent, in the form of <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>.</p>

<p>There was a rather silly problem with cyclical redirects, but it’s all sorted now. I advise that you change your subscription to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/solitudevkps">Solitude FeedBurner Feed</a>, if your feed reader of choice has not already done so.</p>

    <p>Net<acronym title="MiniDisc">MD</acronym> is a fantastic idea: hook up a NetMD player to your computer and just drag music over. Simple.</p>

<p>Of course, anyone who has used one can probably tell you that it isn’t that simple in practice. The default software, OpenMG (known as Sonic Stage in some areas), is dreadful. Prone to crashing, not starting up, ignoring your <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> connection, and a plethora of other problems. The only other official software available is Simple Burner. It takes a <acronym title="Compact Disc">CD</acronym> and transfers the contents over to NetMD very quickly. This, however, only helps if you want to move a CD across, and not a bunch of random songs.</p>

<p>Now there’s a new solution: <a href="http://members.xoom.virgilio.it/paolose/">M3U2SimpleBurner</a>. It is a bit of a beast to set-up (you need either <a href="http://www.daemon-tools.com">Daemon tools</a> or Nero Burning <acronym title="Read Only Memory">ROM</acronym>, as well as Simple Burner and the OpenMG secure modules,</p>

<p>Once you’ve got it all down, you drag your mp3’s into M3U2SimpleBurner and it creates a virtual image (a fake CD that only exists on your computer). You then mount this virtual image onto a virtual drive (created by either Nero or Daemon Tools), and tell the real Simple Burner to use that.</p>

<p>Now, while I haven’t had a chance to use it all properly yet, it still seems like a lot less hassle than the OpenMG software. Only time will tell.</p>

    <p>Some more links because today was boring enough to warrant it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_769300.html?menu=entertainment.latestheadlines">Yorkie gets more sexist</a></strong> – After the rather funny start to the “It’s not for girls” campaign, Nestle take it one step further. Nice,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6f7480bf-3dee-4a28-ade1-419f09e2c394&amp;displaylang=en">American flag screen-saver</a></strong> – There’s nothing I hate more than seeing an American flag flapping in the wind. Not because I’m anti-American, but it’s got be the most cliched image of current times. How many films recently have included a random flag blowing in the wind for the sake of “patriotism”? It’s bullshit and it’s annoying. So, to balance out that mini-rant, you can use that link to download an american flag screen-saver,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.totalobscurity.com/mind/flagstore/">Flag-O-Rama</a></strong> – I can’t decide whether this site is a parody or not. Either way, it’s quite amusing. “Take that, hippie scum! YEEEEE-HAWWWWW”,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2003/04/09/the_petal_storm_begins.html">Petals falling</a></strong> – There’s something quite beautiful about the image on that page. I’m not sure why, but I like it.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/26_things.html">26 things a perfect guy would do (and other propaganda)</a></strong> – Maddox: Idiot, nutcase or genius? Who knows. Any way, it’s a funny article. Number 10 is particularly amusing.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s your lot for the day.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>In an effort to finally figure out why I occassionally collapse and black-out, my doctor suggested that I had a heart monitor attached for 24 hours. This didn’t bother me too much.</p>

<p>When I turned up to have it fitted yesterday, it turns out it wasn’t a heart monitor he wanted fitted; it was a blood pressure monitor. This did bother me. A lot. I really don’t like having my blood pressure taken: restricting my arms, squeezing out my vains, making me lose feeling for a minute or two. It’s not my idea of fun. But, since it was supposedly in my own best interest, I got it attached.</p>

<p>Now, it’s fairly bad when a doctor takes your blood pressure. He can at least figure out how tight it’s supposed to get and get it done quickly. Apparently, machines can’t. It over-inflated almost every time, making sleeping quite difficult. Every hour (or every half hour before 10pm), it would switch on and try to cause my hand to burst. The experience was akin to having a Boa Constrictor attached to your arm; not entirely comfortable.</p>

<p>It’s off now. But I started thinking about the chances of it having found anything. Now, the fact that it kept waking me up last night means that my mathematical prowess is slightly off, but I reckon the chances of it actually picking up one of my crazy-fun-collapso-fits is 900 to 1. That’s not a horse I’d bet on.</p>

    <p>From the tour diary of <strong><a href="http://www.jetplanelanding.com">JetPlane Landing</a></strong> (no direct link due to the diary being opened in a new window – damn JavaScript):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am learning more about cahir’s straight to video cop show. John Cutwire, a european immigrant and now LAPD detective, who doesn’t play by the rules. Renne, a french-canadian bloodhound, that saved Cutwire when he was climbing in the Alps visting the motherland. Noone knows where the motherland actually is. From that day forward they have been partners. Bob, is John Cutwires human partner. Nearly, every episode is about Bob either he’s getting kidnapped, framed, hurt or set-up. The stories are generally about revenge, or trying to prove Bob’s innoncence. Renne has an intense dislike for Bob (I haven’t worked out why yet). Its also important to note that although John Cutwire has a strong Noreweigan accent – his character demands that he be cast as an American, who then puts on the Norweigan accent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly the funniest idea for a TV show ever.</p>

    <p>Recently, to solve a puzzle, I wrote a function in <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocesor">PHP</acronym> that determines whether or not a given string is a palindrome. After a little work, it now works perfectly. It’s not case-sensitive, removes white-space and get’s rid of non-alphanumeric characters.</p>

<p>It’s been added to the <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Index.php">Code archive</a> and can be <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/IsPalindrome.php" title="Palindrome Code">viewed directly</a>.</p>

    <p>Tragedy hit last night for many students when <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4044259.stm">The Shack burned down</a>. Famed among students for cheesey pop, the lack of access will mean having to go to, shock horror, The Garage.</p>

<p><a href="http://stuwee.org">Stuwee</a>, unofficial spokesman for The Shack, was said to be “totally gutted”. Expect him to set up a support group soon.</p>

    <p>Mad, stupid, silly, daft, bizarre, off-colour, odd. All terms that describe <strong>Shaolin Soccer</strong> well.</p>

<p>At it’s core, Shaolin Soccer is about an idea rather than a story. Someone thought it would be a good idea to mix bullet-time special effects, CG effects and wire-fu with the most basic of comic stories to create a surreal football film. The results are stupid but amusing scenes of balls smashing through players like bowling balls.</p>

<p>Although apparently cut for Western release, the film is still entertaining enough to watch.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Up until fairly recently, I didn’t use an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> aggregator. Using my own bandwidth to check so many sites was just hammering my connection, and starting and stopping the application when I needed to reserve the bandwidth was just a pain.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>. Yes, I’m late to the party. People have been praising it for months now but I only very recently saw the light. It is an excellent tool: allowing me to check sites quickly when I want to (and not using up much of my bandwidth), keeping unread items up to date no matter which computer I’m using, and making me far more productive.</p>

<p>Before Bloglines, I was struggling to keep up with about 50 sites regularly. I now easily keep up with around 120. Thoroughly recommended.</p>

<p>Now, I checked my server logs for the first time in months tonight and noticed that a single host had hit my site 2000 times this week. That’s a hit every 5 minutes from one entity. Investigating a little further made it clear that the one entity was an aggregator: the bloglines aggregator.</p>

<p>Now, Solitude is not a high-throughput site. I attempted to update once a day, but it’s usually more like once every two days. In the last week, there have been 3 updates (this being the 4th).</p>

<p>Think about that: 3 updates, 2000 checks. 3. 2000 checks. Notice the ever so slight disparity?</p>

<p>Those Bloglines guys make a very usable interface to a damn fine service, but they really need to work on the crawler updating logic. It’s not that hard to extrapolate predictable update patterns. If a site is updating every 15 minutes, check it every 15 minutes. If it slows down and stays at once every day, 15 minutes is probably very inappropriate. Once an hour would be better. You don’t less any real sense of freshness and you don’t over do server hits.</p>

<p>Common sense and the polite thing to do.</p>

    <p>Let’s get this out of the way: I’m a total arsehole when it comes to music. Like most people, I have very strong musical opinions. I also have enough restraint to know that most people who read this site probably don’t give a shit about my taste in music and hence it rarely, if ever, gets a mention.</p>

<p>I was tempted recently to rip into Dizzee Rascal’s new single, “Dream”, which amounts to the original record with off-key and half-finished singing. I thought better of it, thinking it would be best to let it speak for itself.</p>

<p>Today, however, I say something being advertised that I couldn’t remain silent about. <a href="http://www.junioreurovision.tv/english/index.htm">The Junior Eurovison Song Contest</a>. I am at a total loss as to who thought this was a good idea. The Eurovision song contest is a painful joke, a cruelly perpetrated one at the expense of the Irish who think it’s a good thing to win, but I digress. What sick fuck decided to bring children into it? The humanity, oh, the humanity. I can already imagine the entrants from the backwaters of Europe in their red sequined shirts crying into their milk as they get nil points. Normally, that would amuse me somewhat but, given the setting, it’s just embarassing.</p>

<p>The last thing music needs.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve been trying to think of a good term for a particular kind of music for a while now but nothing immediately springs to mind.</p>

<p>I’m thinking of albums that are technically solid, enjoyable to listen to, but entirely forgettable. The sort that you can’t say anything bad about but probably don’t listen to as much as you should; probably because there’s no particular reason to break it out. Maybe if you see the band live it spurs you to listen to them again, but the notion fades.</p>

<p>The particular album that spurred this doesn’t matter too much I just want a concise way of describing such an album.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>For August, we have 5 films in the Film Fight…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Monsters University</strong> is the entirely unnecessary prequel to what is possibly Pixar’s greatest film, Monsters Inc. It obviously has a heavy burden to live up to its forebear. The good news is that it doesn’t entirely fluff it, though it clearly isn’t operating at the same level. It has a number of funny bits, interesting characters and the charm you’d expect of a Pixar movie, so you won’t miss out in seeing it. That said, it feels like it’s just being made for the money; building out a backstory that no-one needed. It’s good, not great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/364004946032590849">my Monsters University Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Nicholas Winding Refn has directed some excellent films, like Bronson and Drive (which won the <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2011/12/31/film-fight-2011-finale/">2011 Film Fight Finale</a> – even if I latter changed my mind, and decided that Another Earth should’ve won). <strong>Only God Forgives</strong> is not an excellent film; it’s astonishingly bad. While it looks incredible throughout, the rest is pretentious, lacking substance, flimsy and poorly constructed. It’s unevenly paced, has paper-thin characters, and many of the scenes simply do not matter. It is incredibly badly judged on almost every level. A strong contender for the worst film of the year, and certainly the most disappointing.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/366152395161485312">my Only God Forgives Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Kick-Ass 2</strong> manages to be even more nihilistically fun and gleefully violent than its predecessor, which is no easy task given the explosion of colour and carnage of the original. The main plot is about a supervillian uprising, funded by an unexpected source, and a group of vigilantes trying to stand up for normal people while realising they’re not playing a game. There’s a subplot following Hit Girl to high school which has some laughs, but is entirely superfluous to the main plot. On the whole, it’s hit-or-miss, but fun enough that it’s worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/372463768204095488">my Kick-Ass 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Lovelace</strong> is the dark story, based on her biography, of Linda Lovelace, the star of Deep Throat. It is first presented as a “fun” telling of her story (with enough warning signs to see what is coming), but the narrative doubles back to show the horrendous abuse she suffered, essentially being forced into the industry by her then husband. Peter Sarsgaard puts in a terrifically terrifying performance as the abuser, and Amanda Seyfried (an actress whose output I would normally avoid) is very believable as the abusee, showing real vulnerability. Very worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/372464514488221696">my Lovelace Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Elyisum</strong> is Neill Blomkamp’s first film since the very impressive District 9. How has he done with a bigger budget and better known cast? It’s certainly a grander presentation, but a much less effective story. As an allegory, it’s clunky and obvious, whilst as a straight-up story it’s inconsistent. Even the action sequences are, at best, hit-or miss. The physicality of District 9’s action (even though much of that was CG) gives way to some limp shoot-outs with gadgets that you will not care about. The film, tellingly, comes alive each time Sharlto Copley’s character, the main antagonist, is on-screen as he tears himself towards some goal through sheer force of will, even if we don’t care much about said goal. Mostly bad. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/373845463583039489">my Elysium Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>Lovelace</strong>. The performances were worth seeing, and the rest of the production wasn’t exactly slouching either.</p>

    <p>Four films in the Film Fight for July.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The East</strong> is something of a missed opportunity. Having thoroughly enjoyed Brit Marling’s performance in the mesmerising Another Earth, I had high hopes for her in this. I was not disappointed. Marling shows the right mix of vulnerability, naivety and determination for her character (a corporate spy) to make sense. The rest of the cast, however, are a little wasted. We know both Ellen Page and Alexander Skarsgard are capable actors, but here they don’t have much to work with. The film ticks over nicely, until a muddled last act undoes a lot of the ground work, but it’s enjoyable nonetheless. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/352868100921757696">my The East Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Man of Steel</strong>, however, is not worth seeing. It spends twenty or so minutes building up a fascinating mythos and origin at Superman’s home planet which makes you yearn for a better movie called Krypton: Civil War. Sadly, we quickly move to Earth and see an incoherent mess of characters play out pointless CGI battle after CGI battle; motivations and actions being principally determined by the needs of the plot. There’s very little to redeem the film outside of the first stretch; even Michael Shannon can only do so much with his take on General Zod. I’d avoid this, and would have concerns about the rest of the DC universe they’re trying to build out. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/354305247243538433">my Man of Steel Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>If you like big monster films and don’t feel they’ve been done well in a long time, <strong>Pacific Rim</strong> is for you. The plot is dumped through exposition at an alarming rate, a lot of it is clunky, and you’ll see every twist coming a mile away (the pilot that hates the protagonist will eventually grow to respect him? Shock!). That all said, it’s a hell of a lot of fun. Unlike many CG films, it manages to deliver action sequences which are exciting but clearly shown (take that, Transformers), and which you can’t help but get involved in despite the fake nature of it. The comic relief between Charlie Day and Ron Perlman is pitched just right to not be annoying, and the stakes rise at just the right pace throughout the film. One of the better action films of the year. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/359435890671628289">my Pacific Rim Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The World’s End</strong> sees Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reunite for a comedy simultaneously smaller and much larger than their previous efforts. It follows the reunion of a group of old friends determined to finished a pub crawl in their old home town, when something apocalyptic begins to happen. The details of that, I’ll leave to the film, but the first moment you really see something is wrong is excellent. The remainder of the film is fun but not particularly funny. If you see it as a silly adventure, rather than a pure comedy, then you’ll be okay. Decent.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/361591185229348867">my The World’s End Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Tough to call the winner here, but I think I’ll go with <strong>Pacific Rim</strong>. While The East is a very good film, Pacific Rim edges it as the film I’d most like to see again right now.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/08/12/film-fight-2013-june/">Film Fight 2013: June</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Yes, yes, it’s late, I know. For June, we have 5 films in the Film Fight.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Purge</strong> has an interesting enough premise: for one night, the rule of law is suspended in order to allow people to exercise their pent-up emotions. Murder, as you might guess, is rampant, and this goes predictably badly for the protagonists of the piece. The problem with the film is that it can’t seem to settle on what it wants to be: it sets up a social commentary but doesn’t give it the time to breath, instead degenerating into a home invasion horror with just a hint of Funny Games thrown in. If it had focussed on either side, it might have been better, but as-is it’s a predictable and mindless horror. It’s not awful, but you won’t see it again any time soon. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/341654142634295296">my The Purge Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Iceman</strong> sees Michael Shannon deliver another mesmerising performance as an ice-cold hitman. His paranoia and shady dealings see his life beginning to unravel in ways he can no longer control. It’s not exactly an original story (though it’s based on a true one), but the lead performance makes it worth the admission by itself. Even though some of the supporting cast are notably weak (you’ll want to switch off any time his family appear) and the last section feels rushed, it’s still a great film. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/344588014556676096">my The Iceman Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Whedon’s first film after The Avengers couldn’t be much more different: <strong>Much Ado About Nothing</strong> is a timeless take on the Shakespeare play. It is fantastically well-done. The cast, stuffed with Whedon alumni, nail every part, bringing out the wit and comedy of the source material in every scene. It’s beautifully shot, shown in black and white, with nothing extraneous to slow down the pacing. There’s not a moment where you feel that it doesn’t work, and that’s without compromising the play for a modern audience. An excellent film that feels small and perfect. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/347831755018997760">my Much Ado About Nothing Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>I am a big zombie move fan but having heard about the post-production issues with <strong>World War Z</strong>, I didn’t hold out much hope. I was surprised to find, then, a film that was not without charm. While every character in the film was utterly two dimensional, there merely to service the plot, the whole thing worked quite well as a big, dumb action film. The pacing was frantic for all but the last act, which was a nice little diversion. It’s certainly not a masterpiece, but it was quite fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/350956013538656256">my World War Z Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>This Is The End</strong> is the epitome of Judd Apatow style comedies. If you hated or loved Superbad, Knocked Up or Pineapple Express, you’ll feel exactly the same about this. By now, you’ll undoubtedly have heard that it features James Franco, Seth Rogen et al. playing versions of themselves at a party on the fateful night of the apocalypse. Hopefully you won’t have heard about too many of the cameos or the silly ending, as there are some great moments that shouldn’t be spoiled. Again, this film will really depend on how you feel about the cast. I enjoyed it, but if you’ve seen them before you know what you’ll think. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/351792782114947074">my This Is The End Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for June is <strong>Much Ado About Nothing</strong>, a flawlessly executed take on a classic. Contender for film of the year.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/06/10/film-fight-2013-may/">Film Fight 2013: May</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The first batch of big summer blockbusters have arrived, alongside some more thoughtful films, making for five films in today’s Film Fight for May.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Iron Man 3</strong> is the prototypical big-budget, CG-heavy, plot-light blockbuster we’ve come to expect from much of Marvel’s output (Avengers aside). This movie, however, gets ideas above its station, trying to instill more human qualities in its protagonist by giving him a young boy as a sidekick for a reasonable portion of the movie. It fails badly, as the kid is thoroughly unlikeable, Stark’s interactions with him (and many other ordinary people) are creaking and awkward, and he all but gets dropped out of the last act, making his set-up pointless. There are decent set-up pieces about The Mandarin, but the mid-film reveal is silly and he is replaced by generic baddies fighting lifeless CG battles. You’ll stop caring about anyone by the half-way mark, if you cared at all. The worst entry in the Marvel Film universe since Hulk. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/331859813006991361">my Iron Man 3 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A better big budget film wasn’t far away, in the form of <strong>Star Trek: Into Darkness</strong>. It’s light-hearted, enjoyable, nonsense; the plotholes are many and consistency is low, but it’s fast and it’s fun. By the time your brain catches up, you’ll be on your way home. It’s weakest point is the relationship between Kirk and Spock. It’s sold as a strong bond, but it’s difficult to buy that after they’ve had so little screen time together, much of which they’ve spent despising each other. Ignore that, and you’ve got a decent film, but certainly not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/333287296348590081">my Star Trek: Into Darkness Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Matthew McConaughey continues a recent run of excellent performances (Lincoln Lawyer, Killer Joe, The Paperboy) in <strong>Mud</strong>, a movie about two young boys finding a man hiding in a swamp, and the few days that follow. While the pacing is as mired as the setting, you couldn’t ask for a better cast of character actors. They do their best to keep things moving forward, but it’s slow going. It’s worth sticking with it though. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/334430825250709504">my Mud Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Upstream Color</strong> is Shane Carruth’s first movie since his debut, the excellent Primer. Where that film was difficult because of the complexities of time travel being depicted as naturalistically as possible, Upstream Color is a challenge for many other reasons. It’s a beautiful mess of fast edits, dreamy music, half told moments, pieces that don’t quite fit and motivations that are far from apparent (Carruth himself has said he’s bothered by the motives of the voyeuristic sound recorder). I won’t begin to describe what this film is about. It’s involved, but worthy of the time it’ll take you to truly consider it. A classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/336148916296892418">my Upstream Color Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Dragon</strong> is a very interesting idea: it plays out as a Chinese period take on Cronenberg’s A History of Violence, swapping out the mafia for martial arts. It should’ve been good, but too much of the film is played for laughs; silly and slapstick, where it would have benefitted from being more sombre and serious. A wasted opportunity. (see <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/338681997843132416">my Dragon Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for May is <strong>Upstream Color</strong>, for its unique vision.</p>

<p>Note: Upstream Color won’t appear in UK cinemas until later this year. You can wait until then, or get a US copy imported (I got a region-free copy).</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>There are six films in the Film Fight for April, making it quite a busy month…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Compliance</strong> is a worrying look at control, and how someone that seems like an authority figure can cause serious problems without being questioned. Based on a true story, it shows how a man posing as a police officer over the phone talks the manager of a fast food place into some highly questionable behaviour. It explores its theme well, despite overextending a few scenes to pad out the paltry runtime. The performances are reasonable, and the film manages to hold interest despite a few pacing issues. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/319559547440230401">my Compliance Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Trance</strong> is the latest work by director, Danny Boyle. It’s a typically stylish and slick heist movie about the theft of a painting, with all the hallmarks of a Boyle movie. That includes the expected last-act twist, which is so utterly predictable and surrounded by silliness as to fall apart under its own weight. Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson were both great, but the rest of the film was hampered by the ridiculous premise. Watchable, but not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/320483658995740672">my Trance Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Maniac</strong> is an entirely forgettable, modern-day, B-movie slasher film. Its one gimmick, the point of view camera, starts to lose its appeal very quickly, and forces the film to rely on cliche: the killer with mother issues, obsession with (essentially) dolls, people that can’t run away or make silly choices etc. There’s nothing in this film that you haven’t seen many times before, so there’s very little reason to see it again. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/320485707242168320">my Maniac Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A brilliant cast, lead by Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, makes <strong>The Place Beyond The Pines</strong> a particularly bold movie. It compares the actions and decisions of three men over the course of several decades to show how blurry the line between good and bad is, how only a handful of choices and circumstance keep us from going down much darker paths. The narrative is sprawling, but never confusing, and the arguments it makes are convincing. It’s let down, in part, by a weak final act, focussing a little too much on weaker characters brought together by serendipity. A classic film that deserves to be remembered. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/324633989249908736">my The Place Beyond The Pines Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Spring Breakers</strong>, meanwhile, follows a handful of young girls as they head off the rails in an attempted satire of selfishness and hedonism. It attempts this by painting a dream-like, neon unreality; glitches in the cutting used to put multiple takes together, with a never ending stream of music. Sadly, it fails utterly in its goal. It comes across, for the most part, as sluggish and dull. There’s no substance here, or even a strong message, just vague ideas presented vaguely. Awful. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/324995658308259841">my Spring Breakers Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Olympus Has Fallen</strong> was being billed by some as a modern take on Die Hard, as the most recent Die Hard films are nothing like the original. It doesn’t live up to that, but it is a surprisingly fun, if utterly dumb, action film. There are a whole heap of big action set pieces to keep you interested (including a surprising opening sequence). These help hide the many plot holes. If you notice those, you’re paying attention to the wrong things. This is an unabashed, straight-up action film; sensible plotting be damned. Enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/326448792067002369">my Olympus Has Fallen Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner this month is <strong>The Place Beyond the Pines</strong>, for its many excellent choices.</p>

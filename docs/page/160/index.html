  <div class="post">
    <p>I found a link to <a href="http://www.methodize.org/nntprss">nntprss</a> the other day and have to say how great an idea it is. It allows you to read <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds in any newsgroup reading software that you might have.</p>

<p>Now, not a lot of people use newsgroups anymore (compared to when it was <em>the</em> killer app of the net), but I do. So being able to read news from all the sites I visit in a simple straight-forward manner in a familiar interface (in my case, <strong>Outlook express</strong>) is very useful. I recommend this to anyone who uses newsgroups and reads any site with an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed.</p>

<p>I just need to set it up as a windows service, rather than having to use the command prompt everytime I start-up, and it’ll be perfect.</p>

<p>Update: I’ve created a very fast and nasty way or working around the problem of executing nntprss at start-up. Just use the following code as a batch file:<a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/nntp/nntprss.txt">batch-file code</a>.</p>

<p><ins>UPDATE: The word “start” has been added to the code to make the command prompt created by the batch file disappear on completion. Thanks to WildShaft!</ins></p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/03/28/BiffyLanding/">Biffy Landing</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A few nights ago, I went to see the excellent <a href="http://www.biffyclyro.com/">Biffy Clyro</a> play live. Here’s what happened.</p>

<p>First, support band were the very poor <a href="http://www.span.mu/site.php">Span</a>. Sounding very much like a poor man’s <a href="http://www.dankojones.com/">Danko Jones</a> they failed to impress from the outset. This was further compounded by the lead singers ill-advised and badly put speech about George Bush and the war. Unfortunately for him, he was playing in front of a largely pro-war crowd.</p>

<p>Next support band was the amazing <a href="http://www.jetplanelanding.com/">JetPlane Landing</a>, Whom I’ve seen before. They were, as usual, excellent; mixing new songs and old comfortably. From their 8 or so song set 4 new songs were played: the name of the first wasn’t mentioned (I think it was “Effect A Change”), “Strength Of Our Convictions”, “Conventional Thought” (the best of the bunch) and “The Violence”. How many bands are confident enough in their new material to devote half of a half-hour set to it? Importantly, though, it worked.</p>

<p>After what seemed like a moment of absolute genius, they left the stage and made way for <strong>Biffy</strong> themselves. I was surprised by just how good they were (to be honest, it was <strong>JetPlane Landing</strong> as support that convinced me to get a ticket). They rocked. But, at the end of the last song of the main set, Simon, lead singer, decided to jump off the amp stack; he landed badly and had to be carried off stage, and no encore. Turns out his leg is broken.</p>

<p>All in all a good night. I bought another copy of “Zero For Conduct” by <strong>JetPlane Landing</strong>, this time on vinyl and, with the exception of <strong>Span</strong>, enjoyed the whole thing.</p>

    <p><cite>Mike Davison</cite> on the standards-compliant redesign of <a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through a dizzying array of table tricks, transparent spacer images, and JavaScript hacks, we found a way to make things look great to the human eye through the window of a graphical web browser without worrying about what everything looked like under the hood. Now that digital lifestyle devices, tablets, wireless phones, and other Internet appliances are beginning to come of age, we need to worry about presenting our content to these devices so that it is optimized for their display capabilities. Do we want to send a 100KB index page full of Flash, images, and tables to a small wireless device or would we rather send them our top story, our top headlines, and essential navigation to get through our site? By separating our content pieces in a logical way rather than a graphical way, we are free to restyle this content for any device which supports open standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve talked about standards and proper web design more than a few times on this site. It feels good to know that the people in charge of a major site sees it the same way. Who will be next to join the standards race?</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/03/26/StaticArchives/">Static Archives</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A week ago, I was searching for something on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and came across a link to this very site in my search results. It was linked to a page in my archives about <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>. So, I did the natural thing of clicking on it.</p>

<p>Because of the way the archives worked, the page no longer had any entries regarding <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>. Every time a new entry was added, each entry was pushed back by 1 entry on the archive. After 5 entries were added, it had been pushed off that archive page altogether.</p>

<p>This worried me. A <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym> should point to the same information all the time. So I began work on a new archive system today. It’s now done and available for all to see (<a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Archives.php">the Archives are here</a> for those who don’t know).</p>

<p>This time pages are archived by date, rather than some arbitary position that doesn’t matter. So, it’s now far more static and indexable.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/03/24/Oscars/">Oscars</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>Some surprises came out in this years oscars: the only oscar for <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/adaptation/">Adaptation</a> was given to <a href="http://www.oscars.com/oscarnight/winners/win_32287.html">Chris Cooper</a> (Best Supporting Actor). How they managed to lose Best <em>Adapted</em> Screenplay is beyond me. Stupid academy.</p>

<p>I’m quite glad the Lord Of The Rings didn’t win many awards this year. The films have been moderately impressive visually, but quite overblown. There’s a big difference between epics and tedious detail; Peter Jackson just doesn’t see it.</p>

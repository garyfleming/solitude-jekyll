    <p>As much as I expected it to be a big budget wash out, <strong>Pirates Of The Caribbean</strong> is actually reasonably entertaining. <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> leads with his usual balance of excellent timing and quirky delivery, <strong>Keira Knightley</strong> plays her part adequately, and <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>… He showed up.</p>

<p>Yes, the plot is predictable, some of the lines are horribly overwritten, but there are enough mildly amusing bits to make it a worthwhile watch. Certainly a <strong>lot</strong> better than that <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/08/19/Chicago" title="Chicago, tedious film of the year">hideous dog shit</a> I watched later the same day.</p>

    <p>Watching <strong>Chicago</strong> is a lot like falling off a large cliff towards a spike: initially terrifying, your entire life flashing before your eyes, a voice shouting <em>“WHY ME?”</em>, and, just as Richard Gere begins singing, the spike can’t hit you fast enough.</p>

<p>Of course, as soon as you want sweet jagged relief, Father Time pulls a fast one and everything goes excruciatingly slowly. Every note hangs in the air for hours, every word spoken in a forced accent cuts, every torturous second eating away at your will to live.</p>

<p>The end never comes too soon.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/08/14/PermalinksAndData/">Permalinks And Data</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>There’s an old problem with permalinks: they have a tendency to end up not being permanent. You keep a record of articles (bookmarks/favourites) that you know you’ll want to refer back to later. When it comes time to actually use them, the links are broken for whatever reason and you’re left staring at a 404 screen. Not fun.</p>

<p>It’s happened to me once too many times, so I’m going to try to solve the problem for at least my site. My thinking is that servers are outwith the control of most people, even the owner of the site living on the server, thus making it the weakest link in the distribution chain. So, how do we remove reliance on servers to recall information?</p>

<p>The best answer is immediate addressing in the form of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397">Data: <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>‘s</a>. For those who’ve never seen a data:url, it’s a way to store information (images, text, or pretty much anything else) as a link; that is, the link <strong>is</strong> the data, not just a pointer to it. It’s a great concept being used in various ways (not least as a way of beating <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> encryption).</p>

<p>When permalinks meet data:urls, we have a way of storing entries as links. That is, we have bookmarks that will <em>never</em> break.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not without it’s problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> – Not unsurprisingly, <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> does not support data: url’s and won’t do anytime soon. So, those users don’t get the added benefits unless they upgrade.</li>
  <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> – by providing the data on a page and as a link, bandwidth usage is effectively doubled. This is not good. To combat this, I only provide data: permalinks on individual item pages. You’ll have to click through to an entry to get the data permalink.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited space</strong> – Although <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and its derivatives offer data: urls of up to 2Gb, the recently added support in <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> is limited to 4kb. That’s not a lot of room for a full-on essay. Happily, though, it’s easily big enough for <em>most</em> entries around here. Those that are too long get automatically cut down to size and a real permalink added to the end, pointing to the full articale. This is very much a compromise, but one worth making.</li>
  <li><strong>Unclosed Tags</strong> – Related to large essays getting cut down (above), permalinks on this site might have unclosed tags towards the end. This is entirely my fault. Eventually, I will work on a way to automatically close tags that are open, but until I do they’ll be broken. Sorry.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to play with data: urls yourself, there are some good resources. Ian Hickson’s <a href="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/cgi/data/data">data: <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym> kitchen</a> is the best place to generate them for experimentation. Or, if you’re feeling really fruity, there is Simon Willison’s <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/08/11/selfContained#comments">self-contained data: URI kitchen</a>; a reinvention of Ian’s kitchen as a data: uri (confusing yes, useless no).</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch">Ian Hickson</a> for providing the numbers on <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> lengths, and to <a href="http://simon.incutio.com">Simon Willison</a> for reworking the original kitchen and inadvertantly giving me a kick to get this done.</p>

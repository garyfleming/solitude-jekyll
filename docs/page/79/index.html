    <p>Games have never been a major topic on Solitude, save links to flash games and the odd comment about how something has been eating up my time. Given that I’ve been playing games a lot longer than I’ve been interested in web design, computing, music and the other things I’ve been writing about of late, this is a somewhat odd state of affairs.</p>

<p>While the amount of time I spend playing games has been heavily marginalised (very low priority after all), I still like to follow what’s going on and understand significant issues in the gaming world. (Yes, I am an <a href="http://www.edge-online.co.uk/">Edge</a> reader).</p>

<p>So, the next series of posts are going to focus on several gaming related issues. Expect focus to be thrown on the current handheld battles, the pursuit of realism, net gaming (yes, more flash), and possibly some other non-video game topics in the wider world of gaming (of which I have almost no interest).</p>

<p>Non-gamers: switch off for a week.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/01/31/AYearInMusicJanuary2005/">A Year In Music: January 2005</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>There has been a lot on the <a href="http://yourcodenameismilo.com">yourcodenameis:milo</a> front this month. They announced the details of their new EP, Rapt. Dept, which appeared on the 31st January with superb artwork by Storm Thorgerson (who has done Mars Volta artwork), as well as their forthcoming album, Ignoto. The album (due March) will feature one of the finest song titles of all time, “Unfinished Drawing Of Cats”, as a UK bonus track. As well as this, the video for Rapt. Dept appeared and is fantastic, fitting the song like so few videos beforehand. Moody rock picked apart by heavenly imagery, breaking down into a bizarre ethereal spookiness. Incredibly good stuff on both the audio and visual front.</p>

<p>Bands who split: <a href="http://www.mclusky.net">Mclusky</a> have ended it, after 3 great albums, and <a href="http://www.ikaracolt.com">Ikara Colt</a> split on the 16th. Both shall be missed.</p>

<p><a href="http://idlewild.co.uk">Idlewild</a> released the video from new single, “Love Steal Us From Loneliness”. Very loose storyline involving two people who are alone, even when together. A playful enough video, but lacks depth. Idlewild played 5 acoustic shows across the country this month, followed by a full electric tour in April/May.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trailofdead.com">And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead…</a> released their new album, “Worlds Apart”, on the final day of the month. Very heavily hyped, and sounding superb. Trail Of Dead albums have been masterpieces in the past, but this is the one that might live on as seminal.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/01/31/filmfightjanuary2005/">Film Fight: January 2005</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>As observers of this site might know, I had planned on <a href="/Archives/2005/01/03/Changes2005PartThreeRenew">removing film reviews from Solitude</a>, a plan I revised in the comments of that same post a day later. Now the plan was, and is, to wait until the end of the month and compare that months cinema viewing against each other and try to come up with a favourite. This would make my life much easier when it comes for the inevitable best films of 2005 post. As one might expect, there has been a slight hitch in that plan: I’ve only been to the cinema once this month.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.teamamerica.com/">Team America: World Police</a></strong> is what you might expect from Matt Stone and Trey Parker when given puppets: silly plots, stupid characters and blatant attempts to piss off the most people possible. Absolutely hilarious in places, the duo know how to utilise odd mediums to make a point, but it lacks in a lot of places; large gaps of the film just don’t have any jokes. Also, the number of jokes that are taking directly from South Park (the “montage” song, for example) is pretty disappointing.</p>

<p>Still, given there are no other contenders, it’s an easy January victory for Team America.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/01/27/WebAudioPart4ThePoint/">Web Audio, Part 4: The Point</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>What place does audio have in the web, anyway? The first attempts to integrate sound into the mix were dire, the graves of a thousand midi files testimony to that fact. Is there any hope?</p>

<p>Clearly, people aren’t happy with having strange noises thrust upon them. Browsers lacked sufficiently convenient UI to circumvent the problem so, because of aggrevated users, the web fell silent. Opt-in is the best policy for web audio or, at the very least, players which make it easy to stop the noise.</p>

<p>Alternatively, audio could be used completely separately from traditional web content. Largely static web pages with varying amounts of content are perhaps not an ideal way to use media. We tend to go to a web page, skim it and then move on. With the exception of short, atmospheric background audio this is at odds with how we listen to music (typically 3-4 minutes of continous use). Incompatible? Perhaps.</p>

<p>We need pure audio websites if being used at all. Podcasting and radio broadcasts are becoming more common online and there is a market, however niche it may be at the moment. This is the only real future I see for web audio, beyond the current standard of listening to one or two tracks by an artist. However, we should always head the words of the <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt">audioblogging manifesto</a>. A feature for the features sake is usually worthless.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/01/26/WebAudioPart3WhatPlayersNeed/">Web Audio, Part 3: What Players Need</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>There are (generically) two player types for web audio, whether embedded or otherwise:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single stream</strong> – Players which feature a single song or a continous sequence of songs which can’t be control.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi stream</strong> – Players which feature multiple songs, which can be flicked through in some way.</li>
</ul>

<p>The former is not a particularly interesting case; it’s essentially just data (music) down a wire (connection). A reasonably solved problem, but useful for radio and simple repetitive sounds (whether using continual loops is good is not being questioned here).</p>

<p>The latter, however, is not as clear cut as far too many players get it wrong. All mature media players should have a feature set including playlist creation (and manipulation), selection directly from playlist, randomisation (“play a song that has not been played recently, using a random but possibly weighted function”), and continous play (“start the next song when this one finishes, regardless of how next is picked”).</p>

<p>This is one reason why Real player fails. It does allow for playlist playback but not selection or creation, making the feature largely impossible to use seriously.</p>

<p>If players for web audio want to compete seriously then they should take a lesson from established players. Or do at least one usability study. I can’t imagine anyone who thinks many players do half of what they want.</p>

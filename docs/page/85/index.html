    <p>So, Google have got a new toy. <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a> uses some funky javascript to get the top results for your request as you type it, character by character. Although it was a little sluggish at first (slow connection that was being used to download a lot at the same time), it works pretty well.</p>

<p>Just for fun, figure out your own Google Length Weighting. Type in your name, character by character, until a search result appears in the suggestions which will list you at the top (spaces count towards the count). The number of characters is your Google Length Weighting. At the moment, I’m about a 7. What are you?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Of course, within twenty minutes of posting, I find out that someone else has had the same idea. Ned Batchelder has the same <a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/200412.html#e20041210T101332">Google Suggest game</a> (sans numbers).</p>

<p><ins><strong>Update 2:</strong> As it is with all things hackery, good suggestions get made. That is why we now have the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=182186">Google Suggest Firefox Extension</a>. It’s proof of concept at the moment, but I’m sure it’ll be taken further.</ins></p>

    <p>Without wanting to turn Solitude into a running commentary for the <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym>, a news piece on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4070755.stm">PlayStation 2 shortages</a> caught my eye. Hmm, so Sony has “blundered” again with it’s shipping and the net effect is that PS2 is in high demand in the UK? Again. For how many years in a row?</p>

<p>Now, not that I’m cynical, but could this just be the same thing they do every year to get artificial demand up and get some cheap press (“PS2 sells out…”) before releasing the vast number they have in warehouses after New Year? Or, are they really incompetent at this whole numbers thing? I think we all know the answer.</p>

<p>Don’t buy the hype, kiddies, get yourself a console with fun games instead (X-Box or GameCube will be fine), unless you like fighting over the last few copies of a console (I’ve seen it happen – men and children arguing over that last box or the shipment that might come in next week) that will be flooding back onto the market when it means less to PR.</p>

    <p>A thanks to <a href="http://mrry.co.uk">Derek</a> for pointing to a <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym> news story about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4070973.stm">the French royally screwing up an explosives exercise</a>. That is absolutely shocking.</p>

<p>It’s one thing to train sniffer dogs in an airport, it’s the real situation they’ll face, but to plant plastic explosives in a random passengers luggage is just madness. You’re really just asking for the dog to mess up and let it get away. Surely someone saw this coming.</p>

<p>I’m sure with this being in France and all that some will put this in the “News that isn’t news to anyone” category, but I’m genuinely stunned that anyone thought this was a good idea.</p>

  <h3><a href="/solitude-jekyll/Archives/2004/12/01/IHeartHuckabees/">I Heart Huckabees</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s rare that a film is both stupidly funny and funnily intelligent, where existential crisis is explored through hitting people in the face with a spacehopper. <strong>I Heart Huckabees</strong> pulls it off with style.</p>

<p>First, the cast: superb, not a single poor casting decision. Jude Law is the slightly smarmy marketing man that becomes the object of Jason Schwartzman’s hatred. Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin also work well together as the quirky and disturbing existential detectives who investigate Schwartzman’s crisis. The best performance, however, is by Mark Wahlberg. He is spot on with timing, expression, everything. I never liked him before this, but he has gone up hugely in my estimation.</p>

<p>The first hour of the film rips past, exploring the characters, and settles the remainder of the film into a debate on whether everything is interconnected (leading to a harmonious universe) or discrete (leading to a random and cruel universe). Being a slightly surreal comedy (reminding me of the superb Being John Malkovich), it does it in ways that you’ll never see coming. Right up to the end, the film charms; the closing lines are both smirk-worthy and poignant.</p>

<p>One of the best films of the year.</p>

    <p>Tragedy hit last night for many students when <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4044259.stm">The Shack burned down</a>. Famed among students for cheesey pop, the lack of access will mean having to go to, shock horror, The Garage.</p>

<p><a href="http://stuwee.org">Stuwee</a>, unofficial spokesman for The Shack, was said to be “totally gutted”. Expect him to set up a support group soon.</p>

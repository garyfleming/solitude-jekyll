  <div class="post">
    <p>A relatively light February, with only two movies.</p>

<p><strong>The Fighter</strong>, in many ways, is a film you’ve seen before. It’s underdog story about a boxer who gets beaten and eventually, with the love of a good woman, finds his way to glory isn’t particularly novel or surprising. No, what makes it stand out is the quality of the performances from the entire cast. Christian Bale as the titular character’s drug addict brother/trainer is outstanding. Seeing through every twitch and failing, he really makes the character stand out without seeming ridiculous, fully deserving his Oscar. Both Amy Adams and Melissa Leo put in outstanding performances (the later also Oscar-winning), as they tear at what they feel is best for the lead. You’ve seen the story before, sure, but never quite this well done. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/36863067811745792">my The Fighter Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Paul</strong> sees Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up with a CG alien (Seth Rogen) for a fun, if gentle, Saturday afternoon comedy. There are a lot of nice little nods for the sci-fi geeks out there, and some funny moments, but we’re not talking about a classic here. It’s got a good feel, and you could certainly watch a lot worse, but not even the surprise cameos can turn around the fact that this is a little better than average. Fun, but not fantastic. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/41871971675414528">my Paul Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>As I’m sure you’ve guessed, <strong>The Fighter</strong> is the film fight winner for February.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>If you buy a drill, you can can do whatever you like with that drill. Well, not whatever you like: you can’t use that drill as a weapon against someone, or using it on objects that you don’t own. You’d be arrested, beaten or feel other negative effects from society.</p>

<p>What you can do, though, is take it apart to see how it works. You can look at how they managed to fit a powerful motor into such a small space. You can see how the batteries are arranged for charging and replace them with something that holds much more power. You can replace any part with a part of your own choosing; putting together a simple set of instructions to give your drill twice as much torque, for example. You’ll likely void your warranty (as is fair) but, in short, you own that drill and it’s yours to play with.</p>

<p>That’s why I find it pretty ridiculous that <a href="http://geohotgotsued.blogspot.com/">George Hotz is being sued</a> for doing the same thing with his PlayStation 3. He decided that he wanted to be able to run whatever he wanted to do on his own device (a computer that he paid for, just like a standard desktop) and set about figuring out how to do that. That’s a perfectly reasonable thing to do. I know not many people have the time, inclination or ability to do so but, just like the drill, it should be entirely up to the owner of a piece of property to decide what modifications they want to make to it.</p>

<p>Sony decided, instead, to sue him.</p>

<p>You see, a side-effect of being able to run anything on your own computer (in this case the PS3) is that you can run pirated software, if you choose to. George did <em>not</em> choose to do this. He merely put the instructions out there about how to run your own software on your own computer. It was <em>other people</em> who then misused these instructions.</p>

<p>That’s right: he didn’t break the law himself, but his modification made it easier for others to do so. He didn’t incite them to do so, he didn’t suggest that they should, he merely produced that side-effect. This is akin to blaming the drill modifier for someone else using a modified drill in in an illegal manner: unless they said “go attack someone with this modified drill”, it’s really got nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>The saddest part of this is that it could all probably be avoided. Rather than get involved in the fool’s errand of securing hardware against personal use (the determined will always find a way), manufacturers could open up their platform’s for such use in a reasonably controlled manner.</p>

<p>Hardware hackers wouldn’t need to resort to cryptographic attacks with bad side-effects, if the platform owner let them play with it to their heart’s content. Sony actually did this for a while with the OtherOs feature but cut it in a firmware revision — which ultimately caused these issues.</p>

<p>This is important. Sony are essentially arguing that we cannot change the things we buy; that features that we pay for can be removed and we can’t reinstate them to one degree or another; that computing commodities are rented and not bought; and that changes others make and misuse could potentially be our fault. None of this has been true in the past, and we mustn’t let it be true in the future.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">free culture</a> allows modification, remixing and derivation; particularly when we’re not infringing copyright. We should not lose sight of this as we enter an age of EULAs and commodities that we buy but, bizarrely, do not own.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/02/17/on-organising-music/">On Organising Music</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>People tend to build up systems for organising their data only after it’s really needed: we’ll gather related objects together haphazardly until it’s too late and we end up with a clutter. Nowhere is this seen more frequently than in people’s digital music collections.</p>

<p>Invariably, people just shove all of their music into a folder and hope for the best, neither organising or normalising the data. The result is that it’s difficult to find specific files, many files are missing vital metadata (like the artist name), and doing anything takes far longer than it should.</p>

<p>This need not be the case.</p>

<p>I’ve shown a few people who have been interested in organising their music collections the strategy I’ve built-up for keeping clutter free, and I’m going to share it with you. It’s not perfect, but it works well for me. (To be honest, I’m writing this so I can point anyone else who asks towards this guide.)</p>

<p>First of all, if all of your music is relatively popular and well known and you already use it as your main media player, just use iTunes. It has many shortcomings, but if you fit in that sweet spot then save yourself the hassle and just let iTunes take care of it all. That’s it, you lucky ones can go now. Lesson over.</p>

<p>Still here? Great. For anyone who has explored the world of music beyond iTunes, you’ll know that it won’t help fix your metadata or organise your music in a particularly useful way. My solution to that is built largely on top of the tools and music database provided by <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>, a collaborative way of discovering music metadata.</p>

<p>A little background: MusicBrainz aims to be the definitive reference source for online music. Over the last few years, volunteers have gathered a tonne of music metadata onto the MusicBrainz website and set about organising it. There are artists, releases, albums, singles, release groups, collaborations, and every piece of music information that you could need; all of it tagged with unique IDs. I say “every piece” but that’s overstating it. There will always be gaps in what MusicBrainz knows. The good news is that if you spot a missing release from your favourite artist, you can add it to MusicBrainz yourself and then everyone else gets to benefit from it.</p>

<p>Back to the task at hand. You’ll need to grab Picard, the MusicBrainz tagger, from their website. It’s available for Windows, OS X and Linux; and it’s ugly as sin on all of them. Seriously, it’s a terrible looking tool, but it’s very useful.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got Picard, the rest is easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create a Music folder</strong> – This should be empty at first, and represents the golden copy of your data. Absolutely nothing gets in here that hasn’t been properly tagged and vetted. It can be anywhere you like, but keep in mind that you’re going to want to back this up on occasion so keep it somewhere that makes that easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Set-up Picard</strong> – In the Picard preferences, there is a setting for moving tagged files to a specific directory. Pick your new Music folder. You may also want to change the filename format and tweak some of the other settings, but I leave that up to you. Personally, I use “artist/release/artist – track title.mp3” for filenames.</li>
  <li><strong>Add music to Picard</strong> – There are a few ways of doing this, but you can drag and drop music directly into the left-hand panel, or use the add files/folders buttons. If you’ve added music from several albums at once, you probably also want to hit the “Cluster” button. This will attempt to organise the files into groups of untagged releases.</li>
  <li><strong>Search for a matching release</strong> – Select the music you want to tag first, and hit lookup. Musicbrainz will try to use the file’s existing metadata to find a release that matches.</li>
  <li><strong>Save your matches</strong> – If the release it finds looks correct, then save it. Your files will be tagged with all the extra metadata MusicBrainz knows about and an ID so you never have to match it up again, and moved to your Music folder. Once saved you can them remove the release from Picard altogether.</li>
  <li><strong>Scan your misses</strong> – If MusicBrainz either couldn’t find a match or the match it finds isn’t correct, you can use the “Scan” button to try a different approach. This uses audio fingerprinting (like Shazam) to try and automatically match the music using the audio itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Manually</strong> – Use Picard’s manual search to try and find the right release. If you find it, a “Tag” button will appear in the top-right of the release information. Click that, and the release gets imported into Picard so you can drag the music onto it yourself.</li>
  <li><strong>Do It Yourself</strong> – Still no luck? Well, it’s time to get acquainted with the MusicBrainz website to add the artist and/or release yourself. This is pretty straight forward but there’s plenty of information on <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/How_To_Contribute">how to contribute</a>. If you think your files already have some of the data you need to add a release, there is a Picard plug-in for creating a release from a Cluster too.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. Every time you get new music, follow from step 3 and you’ll keep your golden copy in good shape.</p>

<p>As a bonus, if you ever decide to reorganise your Music directory, you can import your tagged music into Picard and it’ll recognise all it. You can then make whatever changes you want (maybe change the filename format) and re-save.</p>

<p>If you happen to be on OS X then the <a href="http://sbooth.org/Max/">Max CD ripper</a> can automatically tag your files as it rips, as it has Musicbrainz integration. You set it up in the same way as Picard and query MusicBrainz before ripping to pull back all of the metadata.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this will be of some help to someone in organising their music and understanding MusicBrainz.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/02/15/jdbc-and-enums/">Jdbc and Enums</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After months of using JPA/Hibernate almost exclusively, I got caught out on a relatively simple bug when using JDBC more directly (well, via Spring’s JdbcTemplate):</p>

<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">public List&lt;SomeObject&gt; fetchSomeObjects(RecordType recordType) {
  Map&lt;String,Object&gt; params = ...//Map creation;
  params.put("recordType", recordType);
  return namedParameterJdbcTemplate.query("select * from someObject where recordType =  :recordType",
    params,
    someRowMapper);
}</pre>

<p>That was from memory, so it may be a little off, but it should give you the basics of what the code was doing. It looks okay to my eyes, but, of course, it wasn’t. When run an exception was being thrown from the bowels of the JDBC code saying that RecordType couldn’t be converted to a JAVA_OBJECT.</p>

<p>Odd, I thought. It had worked perfectly well with an in-memory database (HSQL) but now wasn’t working when deployed on a hosted database (SQL server).</p>

<p>I couldn’t spot it straight away, so a quick debugging session revealed the problem: JDBC doesn’t play nicely with enums. RecordType, an enum, was being passed to JDBC verbatim without any attempt for it to match up with the recordType column (a varchar column); and that just doesn’t work. You need to explicitly convert from an enum to a String.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it was a one-line fix:</p>

<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">params.put("recordType", recordType.toString());
</pre>

<p>It doesn’t read quite as neatly but it works. The fact that the original version reads quite well (the value for “recordType” is called recordType) actually makes the bug harder to spot. Now, back to JPA.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/02/13/film-fight-2011-january/">Film Fight 2011: January</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s 2011 and time for a new Film Fight. I’ve been considering changing the format this year, but have decided against that for now so it’ll be the usual: a paragraph or so for each film, with the best selected as the month’s winner. All the winners are compared, and the year’s film is selected. Easy.</p>

<p>January is always a packed month, with Oscar-baiting meaning that the quality is kept suitably high. In January 2011, there are six movies to be reviewed.</p>

<p>First up, is <strong>It’s Kind of a Funny Story</strong>: an indie film that tries to show how mental illness can affect anyone and is easily misunderstood by non-sufferers, by taking a slightly comedic look at the issues. It doesn’t go far enough in it’s exploration of the issues, often opting for shorthand and stereotypes to make it’s points, which is somewhat disappointing. It does, however, move the plot forward at a good pace, balancing comedic elements (Zach Galifianakis plays a big part, but more does so more seriously than usual) and a romantic subplot with relative ease. It’s not a classic, but it’s a good, kind-hearted film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/24198990337671168">my It’s Kind of a Funny Story Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The King’s Speech</strong> humanises King George VI in a way I hadn’t thought possible. By focussing purely on his speech impediment and his years of suffering and humiliation because of it, we begin to see him as a sympathetic man, rather than purely as an elite Royal. He is, of course, both, and it’s to the filmmaker’s credit that they manage to get this across so clearly. This is successful in large part due to Colin Firth’s fantastic performance; the crushed dignity of the soon to be king made clear in every embarrassed look and stammer. An excellent film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/24200564212502529">my The King’s Speech Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Blue Valentine</strong> is almost an anti-love story. It doesn’t focus on things being difficult and then working out. No, instead it contrasts the beginning and end of a relationship, showing a couple at their worst. Communication break downs at the end of a marriage are intercut with two younger versions of the leads with hope and kindness trying to find their place. It’s sad and well-done, if a little slow. It does a remarkable job of showing how people change. Worth seeing. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/26718714464305152">my Blue Valentine Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>127 Hours</strong> does some unexpected things, not least of all because of what everyone expects from the premise: a climber (played by James Franco) is trapped by a boulder against his arm in a cave and, over several days, is forced to make a very difficult decision. Despite being on his own, and their being relatively little dialogue, Franco brings out an extremely likeable character that you want to get out of this hopeless situation. Every tiny triumph and minute failure will see you gasp in just the right way. When the inevitable happens, the film has really earned it’s most painful moment. A few moments aside, this is a very good film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/27825371772624896">my 127 Hours Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Darren Aronofsky has another classic on his hands with <strong>Black Swan</strong>, the tale of seeking out perfection when the pursuit itself makes perfection much more difficult. Natalie Portman is excellent as a ballerina who practices obsessively, even when her obsession – her madness – stops her from seeing the world correctly. It’s surreal, dark, sensual and unnerving: we’re never allowed to know how much of what we see is real and what is imagined. I won’t spoil it, but the ending is excellent: finding the right mix of closure and mystery to round out an altogether astounding movie. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/29237168006242304">my Black Swan Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>NEDs</strong> shows how one young boy is repeatedly failed by those in authority around him, forcing him down the path he’s been trying to avoid for years. We see his fall into violence and crime, despite his brightness, and can imagine how it could have been avoided if people had acted with a little more kindness and less judgement. NEDs, then, is a morality tale; a look a reaping what we sow and then blaming the crops for withering. Brutal in places, but a stunning watch. Very good. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/31748812947062784">my NEDs Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my preface, there are a number of good films this month. Five of the six would easily have won in other months (and the sixth, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, would’ve done well in some). If forced to watch just one again, I’d pick <strong>Black Swan</strong>; and that’s why it’s the first winner for 2011.</p>

    <p>Time is quite important to us all and something I’ve been thinking about a bit recently. Not in any really deep way, mind.</p>

<p>On Friday, my watch stopped. This, to me, is devastating. I check my watch constantly to make sure I’ve got enough time to do whatever I want to before having to go do something else (I’m watching the computer clock now to make sure I’ve got enough time to write this before going out).</p>

<p>Now being a Friday meant that I couldn’t get a new battery fitted until today (Monday). So I thought, “Hmm… wear one of your other watches”. What did I find? They’re <em>all</em> broken. I let them cut out one after another, moving onto the next without replacing the last. Stupid mistake! So, I had to endure a weekend of not knowing exactly what time it is. This bothers me.</p>

<p>Only yesterday, British Summer Time started, often shortened to <acronym title="British Summer Time">BST</acronym>. Now, that won’t mean much to most people, but losing an hour in bed means a lot to me, especially since I’ve been sleeping quite erratically recently. Why can’t we just keep getting an extra hour in bed? After 12 years of moving forward <em>twice</em> a year (instead of forward once and back once), things would end up working out.</p>

<p>Shit, why not move forward twice a month and we’d get the whole cycle sorted inside a year and get plenty of extra time in bed? Best plan of all time, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole situation has worked out: I’ve adjusted to the hour stolen from me (still looking forward to getting it back in October), and two of my watches are now working.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>In addition to <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030328172913">changes made a few days ago</a>, I’ve updated my style sheets again. This time I’ve removed elements common to both style sheets and all of my other style sheets. Basically, this amounts to all the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> for the buttons I use, my margin-collapsing rules and other common elements being thrown together in one place to be used ad infinitum. Hooray for re-use!</p>

<p>Separately, I’ve made the margins for lists smaller, the text for them bigger and their headings (dt in definition lists) bigger. There are a few more little changes that won’t be noticed at all. This post is really just so I remember when I did what; feel free to ignore.</p>

    <p>A man arrested for insider dealing has <a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html">claimed he is a time traveller</a>. In trying to explain how he went from $800 dollars to a portfolio worth $350m he claimed he was from 200 years in the future.</p>

<p>The full article adds some odd details but I, <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/03/29/#timeTravellerInsiderTrading" title="Simon Willison talks about the time traveller">like others</a> suspect this is an early April Fool’s Joke.</p>

    <p>I’ve made some very minor changes to both of the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> files this site currently uses.</p>

<p>All paragraphs have a larger leading space, a greater line height and slightly larger font. Combined, these changes make things a bit easier to read (hopefully). It’s still in need of some tweaking but that can wait until some other day.</p>

<p>If you can’t see a difference, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> together to reload the stylesheet.</p>

    <p>I have no idea what practical use I could have for this, but Kevin from <a href="http://centricle.com/">Centricle</a> has added a <a href="http://centricle.com/archive/2003/03/ruler">favelet that works as a ruler</a>.</p>

<p>This is quite cool in that it shows how far favlets can be pushed. Worth messing around with for a while, at least.</p>

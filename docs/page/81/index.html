  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/01/12/PubCrawlsPart2SauchiehallCrawl/">Pub Crawls, Part 2: Sauchiehall Crawl</a></h1>

    <p>Another pub crawl, this time entirely in the city centre of Glasgow, is the Sauchiehall Crawl. It takes a very different approach to the <a href="/Archives/2005/01/11/PubCrawlsPart1Subcrawl">Subcrawl</a>, and is more of a challenge.</p>

<p>The concept is this: start at the Buchannan Galleries end of Sauchiehall Street (you will have no trouble finding it) and get to Driftwood within an hour. As a walk, it’d be easily achievable (10 minutes or so?). You must, however, have a drink in as many pubs as you possibly can along the way (there are <em>plenty</em> to choose from). You judge the crawl based on the number you manage to get to inside an hour. If you make it to Driftwood late, you lose.</p>

<p>An interesting speed crawl, leaving you poised perfectly for getting to several clubs and bars, or heading into the West End. The West End, of course, will be the venue for pub crawl 3.</p>

  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>A series of posts on pub crawls in the fine city of Glasgow could not be started with anything other than the mighty <a href="http://www.subcrawl.co.uk/">Subcrawl</a>. Otherwise known as the Clockwork Orange, it’s a bit of a big one.</p>

<p>For those who have never heard of it (or been to Glasgow), the premise is simple: Glasgow has a 15 stop, circular underground. The idea is to get off at every stop, go to the nearest pub and have a drink. A great way of getting the full flavour of Glasgow (seeing pubs all over the place), but with some problems.</p>

<p>First, you should aim to clear Govan, Ibrox and Kinning Park as quickly as possible. Not the best of areas, especially for non-regulars or tourists. Secondly, you miss the East End, Merchant City, and some other nice areas of the city. Not that the Subcrawl will give you a chance for sightseeing, since you’ll be rushing around the underground.</p>

<p>The whole thing takes up to 10 hours (for large groups, with a food stop) so will wipe out an entire day from pub opening, but well worth the effort.</p>

    <p>A quick request: does anyone know of any good flash radio stations? The best one I’ve seen so far is the absolutely fantastic <a href="http://www.captainsof.com/player2.html">Captain’s Of Industry player</a>, featuring stuff by a lot of good rock bands.</p>

<p>Requirements: preferably rock, indie, metal, punk or otherwise listenable guitar and drums based music. It also has to use Macromedia flash to deliver the sound.</p>

<p>I’m asking because I want music to listen to in the lab, and I’m sick of trying to get Real player working on Linux.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <p>Yes, it’s that time of year when this fine site celebrates its birthday. Solitude started <a href="/Archives/2003/01/10/NewSiteSoon" title="The first post to Solitude">two years ago today</a>, promising that a new version of VKPS (from whence Solitude came) would be dropping soon. We are all, I’m sure, still waiting (it’ll be a while yet).</p>

<p><a href="/Archives/2004/01/10/AYearOf" title="The first birthday post">Last year</a>, promises were made about more on web design, an undisclosed project, more fiction and more toys. In true Solitude fashion, none were delivered.</p>

<p>This year I’ve very recently talked about <a href="/Archives/2005/01/03/Changes2005PartThreeRenew">my plans for the site’s future</a>, so will not bother to reiterate those. The new sister site of Solitude has indefinitely slipped due to my home computer being incapacitated. I had originally intended (a month or so ago) that it would launch today, but circumstances outwith my control conspired against me.</p>

<p>Being more realistic than previous years, post content will remain somewhat light for the first half of the year while I finish this last crucial part of university life. It will hopefully pick up after then, with some interesting stuff along the way.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we’ll see you for another year.</p>

    <p>As has been mentioned before, Solitude will be undergoing some changes in the near future. Some are purely aesthetic, some are not.</p>

<p>First of all, there will be no more film reviews. I don’t think they are useful posts, and I don’t think many people like them (despite the moderate level of commentary they produce, and reasonable number of searches that they appear in). I only write them because I’m one of those <a href="/Archives/2005/01/02/Changes2005PartTwoCull">digital hoarders that I mentioned yesterday</a>. Without them, I can’t remember films I saw or most of what I thought of them. I’ll keep writing them, but they are unlikely to appear anywhere public online.</p>

<p>Next up, I rather like these vaguely connected posts. A chance to brain dump things that are semi-related in my head gives the site some consistency (in the weakest sense of that word). So, expect posts to be collected together as they make sense to me. This might mean a more bursty post rate (5 in 5 days, followed by a weeks silence).</p>

<p>Random links have recently moved to the sidebar. This change is working and will stay in effect. My concerns with this are the lack of credit for links (backlinks make the world go round) and comments. The former is unavoidable just now, but I think I can come up with some way of addressing the latter; it’s just not trivial.</p>

<p>Around six months ago, I came up with a plan to rebuild VKPS (the site for which Solitude is ostensibly a sidetrack). It never came to fruition due to time constraints. The plan was to bring Solitude and 3 new sites together under some framework. University has to come first, but the first of those 3 sites is set to drop within a fortnight. If I’m being honest, I haven’t done any concrete work for it yet (beyond a dozen scribbled ideas for content). It is likely the release date will falter due to University starting back. I will try though.</p>

<p>Final point: I’m not sticking by any of these. If you disagree (or agree) with anything here, or can think of any other changes, comment. I’m listening.</p>

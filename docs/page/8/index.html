    <p>The last Film Fight of the year sees five films try to get that final place…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>6 Days</strong> is a dramatic retelling of the 1980 siege of the Iranian Embassy in London. It doesn’t quite work. The runtime doesn’t allow it to build out the plot too much, and most of the characters are left as sketches. The attempts to build tension (leaving a critical phone ringing for too long, for example) are ineffective and cliched. It’s not entirely a waste of time, but is somewhat forgettable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/939824795729793024">my 6 Days Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>James and Dave Franco do a great job of humanising the making of notorious B-movie, The Room, in the strangely good <strong>The Disaster Artist</strong>. The how and why of The Room is compelling enough, but James Franco is fantastic as Tommy Wiseau, the strange figure who starred in, wrote, and directed it. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/940274393401438209">my The Disaster Artist Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>It seems like <strong>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</strong> has divided viewers. Some people seem to think it was amazing and others seem to think it was terrible. I thought it was pretty average. It’s <em>far</em> too long, with a number of aimless b-plots in there to service characters who would’ve been better off left on the benches. The plot holes are glaring from the start, but the universe and main cast are interesting enough to overcome that. It’s fun, but far from the best the series has to offer. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/942402312005472261">my Star Wars: The Last Jedi Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>As Netflix’s biggest bet to date, there’s a lot of interest around <strong>Bright</strong>. Set in a modern day Los Angeles where fantasy creatures (Orcs, Elves, fairies) have been common-place for thousands of years, Bright follows the first Orc to become a police officer and his partner (Will Smith). At times the world-building is a little expositional, but it helps develop a rich setting around some fun action. It’s flawed, for sure, but is very watchable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944998691202650112">my Bright Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>El Camino Christmas</strong> is a low-budget Christmas film, suffering from a so-so script. It’s not TV movie bad, but it’s not great. The most notable thing in it is Tim Allen who, despite having little to work with, delivers a far better performance than was needed. Lightweight, throw-away, okay. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944998966030229505">my El Camino Christmas Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for December is <strong>The Disaster Artist</strong>. It’s not exceptional, but does tell a weird and interesting story.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2017/12/film-fight-2017-november/">Film Fight 2017: November</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>November has six films in the fight…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>1922</strong> is another Stephen King adaptation which, as always, could be great or terrible. Set on a farm in Nebraska, Thomas Jane plays a farmer who connives to kill his wife (played by Molly Parker) for her money. Jane puts in an excellent performance, the character’s quietness meaning he has a lot of work to put in with just his face and posturing. Visually, it’s beautiful, with some fantastic shots. Very watchable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/926842962180493312">my 1922 Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Wheelman</strong> is a surprisingly good action film, despite its modest budget. A heist gone wrong sees the driver extorted to complete certain tasks, while trying to figure out what happened. Frank Grillo does well in the lead, creating a believable but sympathetic criminal. The action itself is tense and claustrophobic, and cleanly shot. This is as solid as anything you’d get in a larger cinematic release. Worth seeing.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/927588568981278720">my Wheelman Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>It’s hard to watch the films of Yorgos Lanthamos. <strong>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</strong> is no exception. His style strips the delivery of dialogue of all emotion and presupposition. We’re forced to deal with the reality of the story and the movements of the characters without being allowed to take sides based on their inner state. That’s very weird and uncomfortable. The story itself is familiar but the telling drives us into an unreality. Slow and difficult, but decent. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/927589255500697600">my The Killing of a Sacred Deer Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Florida Project</strong> is a sad story that is far too close to reality for far too many people. It follows a
 young girl and her (young) mother as they scrape by in a motel in Florida. The bright palette used throughout is in stark contrast to the dark story. Willem Dafoe is great as a motel manager, who tries to do his best to help. Equally heartbreaking and beautiful. The story ends just at the right moment, on an idea rather than an answer. Must see. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/929783555634487297">my The Florida Project Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>After Wonder Woman managed to do well for the DCEU earlier in the year, how will <strong>Justice League</strong> fare? Eh… not well. There are some decent action moments and funny bits (mostly revolving around The Flash), but what we get is vapid and awful. It’s expositional, incoherent, and cliched. While it’s not as egregiously bad as, say, Suicide Squad, it’s probably best to just avoid it. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/934821081025843200">my Justice League Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Jim &amp; Andy</strong> is about what Jim Carrey put himself (and the rest of the production) through to become Andy Kaufmann for the biopic, Man On The Moon. Given it was Carrey who captured the footage, it’s a little one-sided and uneven, but he doesn’t paint himself in a glorious light. It’s interesting enough as his perspective, though. Decent. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/936282160134270976">my Jim &amp; Andy Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for November is <strong>The Florida Project</strong>, for its fantastic portrayal of some very real problems.</p>

    <p>A huge month, with eight films appearing!</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Bladerunner 2049</strong> is the sequel I’ve been most worried about in the last few years. I was at least hopeful when Denis Villeneuve, director of last year’s excellent Arrival, was announced as director. I wasn’t disappointed. Let’s get the bad out of the way first: it’s probably a bit too long. That said, the slow and deliberate pacing that lets you soak in the world is a big part of what makes the mood work. We get shown some absolutely immaculate visuals, particularly in the Wallace Corp. building, and a soundtrack that lives up to the original. The story itself and the questions it raises are worthy of this being made. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/918154431446880257">my Bladerunner 2049 Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>You never know what you’re going to get with a Stephen King adaptation but <strong>Gerald’s Game</strong> is on the better end of the spectrum. It’s a small horror, set largely in one room, that manages to build a lot of tension through a simple premise. The coda is completely unnecessary (and detracts from the film), but it’s decent enough overall. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/922456275161698306">my Gerald’s Game Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Time loop films are some of my favourites so I was happy to see that <strong>Happy Death Day</strong> was mixing Groundhog Day style loops with a slasher film. A girl is murdered on campus repeatedly, and has to figure out what’s happening. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, despite the subject, making it very watchable. The end is somewhat predictable, it’s not a classic, but I’d still watch it again at some point. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/922456878839468033">my Happy Death Day Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Babysitter</strong> is a comic book horror that wants to wink to the camera. It tries to ape the visual style of Edgar Wright, without quite pulling it off; I’m more than happy for the attempt, though. It’s a bit cheesey and cheap, but dumb fun. Have with a drink and enjoy. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/922457155491508224">my The Babysitter Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Armando Iannucci has a tonne of great satire behind him, so it’s initially a little strange that <strong>The Death of Stalin</strong> isn’t quite that. It’s less farcical than expected, with a much darker vein running through it. That’s not a bad thing. There some great lines and moments, making for a brilliant look at the period. Must see. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/923615688618627072">my The Death of Stalin Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Bomb Scared</strong> is a dark, comedic farce about an ETA unit failing to do anything of note. It’s reminiscent of Four Lions, with the subject matter and style, and that is in its favour. Worth seeing for the sometimes excellent dialogue. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/923616009910702081">my Bomb Scared Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>After the dour Thor: The Dark World, it’s great to see <strong>Thor: Ragnarok</strong> lighten up. It has a weird comedic tone, that works surprisingly well. It’s probably the funniest MCU film since to date, with some fantastic new characters. It does suffer from some plotting issues, and the villain is ill-defined, but it is still worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/924592943993892865">my Thor: Ragnarok Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Meyerowitz Stories</strong> is surprising for a few reasons. It manages to get some excellent dramatic performances from comedic actors. Both Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller turn in pretty damn good performances. That’s the only real positive here. It’s a tedious slog of a film. I wanted to like it but found myself bored through almost every scene. Dull. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/924593376896405504">my The Meyerowitz Stories Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for October is <strong>Bladerunner 2049</strong> as, despite the length, it delivers everything you’d want in a sequel.</p>

    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The first month in a while where Netflix Originals haven’t outnumbered cinema releases. Six films in total.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Logan Lucky</strong> sees Steven Soderbergh take on a quirky heist, with an over-the-top cast of characters. It sounds like it shouldn’t work as well as it does, but it’s a lot of fun. The cast is excellent, and the direction pulls it all together slickly. The final act is way too long, but it’s otherwise good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/904339930318503937">my Logan Lucky Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson in a buddy comedy about hitmen should work a little better than this film, <strong>The Hitman’s Bodyguard</strong>. The storytelling is heavy-handed (lots of exposition) and the pacing is uneven. The humour and action moments help smooth things out a little. Fine. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/907573242096967680">my The Hitman’s Bodyguard Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Darren Aronofsky is a director with few mis-steps, Noah being the most obvious. <strong>mother!</strong> sees him back at the top of his game. I can’t adequately describe the film, it has to be experienced. That experience is suffocating, tense, visceral, surreal, and beautiful. The plot is fairly indirect, but there are obvious motifs and parallels to think consider long after you’ve left the screen. It takes time to settle after you’ve seen it. Great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/909493871733886976">my mother! Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>American Assassin</strong> is spy thriller cliche after cliche. There are no original beats, even if it ticks over well enough. I saw this just 3 months ago and I can barely remember a single scene. Forgettable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/909494288618311680">my American Assassin Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Angelina Jolie directs the beautiful yet brutal look into the rise of the Khmer Rouge, <strong>First They Killed My Father</strong>. Seen almost entirely from the perspective of the children of a displaced family, we see the atrocities that the organisation inflicted upon the ordinary people. Worth seeing, but could do with being edited down slightly. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/910465566732902400">my First They Killed My Father Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Kingsman: The Golden Circle</strong> sees us return to the over the top world from the original Kingsman film. The comic-book spy action and sense of humour are intact, but the film is flabbier; trying to service far too many characters leaves us wanting a little less. Okay.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/910546864914747393">my Kingsman: The Golden Circle Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for September is <strong>mother!</strong>, for being another stunning cinematic experience.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Another big month with 7 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Incredible Jessica James</strong> is a decent indie film about a woman teaching kids how to act and write, while trying to sort out her own career as a playwright. It’s a little uneven, but it’s a film with a good heart. The final scene is far too cheesy, but that’s a small moment. Watch. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/892782447787732992">my The Incredible Jessica James Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Chadwick Boseman turns in an excellent performance in <strong>Message From The King</strong>, a pretty decent indie crime thriller. As most of these things go, there are no big surprises or huge stand-out moments but everything works reasonably well, a few bad lines aside. Reasonably good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/897187588372656128">my Message From The King Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>I was excited to see another time-loop comedy but <strong>Naked</strong> doesn’t deliver. It’s obviously low-budget, but it’s also weakly-written and doesn’t seem to care much about its concept. The lead is caught in a time loop mere hours before his wedding, starting off naked. It errs between being precise about the timing, and then being extremely loose. Some laughs, but mostly meh. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/898869072900771840">my Naked Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>On paper <strong>What Happened To Monday</strong> should be something I would enjoy: a sci-fi action film about cloning in a world where you can only have one child, starring Noomi Rapace and Willem Dafoe. It doesn’t live up to that hope. There are plot holes everywhere, some terrible dialogue, and mediocre acting throughout. There are some interesting ideas, but they can’t overcome the poor execution. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/898869456088088576">my What Happened To Monday Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Charlize Theron continues to be an action badass in <strong>Atomic Blonde</strong>. The movie is stylish but slowly paced, building up the world around Theron’s secret agent. The action set-pieces are exceptional, with one lengthy fight in a stairwell likely being the best action sequence of the year. So many good fights. Watch. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/899732292234555392">my Atomic Blonde Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>You know how Tom Cruise has two modes of late? He either does sincere action-guy, or somewhat charismatic but down to earth rogue. <strong>American Made</strong> sees him do the latter. It’s a true-ish story about a drug smuggler. Well-made, with a decent pace, and fun enough. It’s easy to watch, but not particularly standout. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/901168713168293888">my American Made Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Death Note</strong> is an adaptation of an anime series, in which a young boy gets a book that allows him to kill anyone he likes. As you might expect, there are consequences. The film rushes through a lot you would like to see explored more, but the depth of the premise is apparent by the end. I’d have preferred a mini-series to allow the story to breath, but it’s still watchable. Willem Dafoe is particularly good as the demon, Ryuk, who controls the book. Decent. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/902602776102002690">my Death Note Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for August is <strong>Atomic Blonde</strong>. An easier win than most months recently, but not undeserved.</p>

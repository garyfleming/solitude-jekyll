<h1 class="title"><a href="/Archives/2003/03/28/BiffyLanding/">Biffy Landing</a></h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>A few nights ago, I went to see the excellent <a href="http://www.biffyclyro.com/">Biffy Clyro</a> play live. Here’s what happened.</p>

<p>First, support band were the very poor <a href="http://www.span.mu/site.php">Span</a>. Sounding very much like a poor man’s <a href="http://www.dankojones.com/">Danko Jones</a> they failed to impress from the outset. This was further compounded by the lead singers ill-advised and badly put speech about George Bush and the war. Unfortunately for him, he was playing in front of a largely pro-war crowd.</p>

<p>Next support band was the amazing <a href="http://www.jetplanelanding.com/">JetPlane Landing</a>, Whom I’ve seen before. They were, as usual, excellent; mixing new songs and old comfortably. From their 8 or so song set 4 new songs were played: the name of the first wasn’t mentioned (I think it was “Effect A Change”), “Strength Of Our Convictions”, “Conventional Thought” (the best of the bunch) and “The Violence”. How many bands are confident enough in their new material to devote half of a half-hour set to it? Importantly, though, it worked.</p>

<p>After what seemed like a moment of absolute genius, they left the stage and made way for <strong>Biffy</strong> themselves. I was surprised by just how good they were (to be honest, it was <strong>JetPlane Landing</strong> as support that convinced me to get a ticket). They rocked. But, at the end of the last song of the main set, Simon, lead singer, decided to jump off the amp stack; he landed badly and had to be carried off stage, and no encore. Turns out his leg is broken.</p>

<p>All in all a good night. I bought another copy of “Zero For Conduct” by <strong>JetPlane Landing</strong>, this time on vinyl and, with the exception of <strong>Span</strong>, enjoyed the whole thing.</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>As has been mentioned before, Solitude will be undergoing some changes in the near future. Some are purely aesthetic, some are not.</p>

<p>First of all, there will be no more film reviews. I don’t think they are useful posts, and I don’t think many people like them (despite the moderate level of commentary they produce, and reasonable number of searches that they appear in). I only write them because I’m one of those <a href="/Archives/2005/01/02/Changes2005PartTwoCull">digital hoarders that I mentioned yesterday</a>. Without them, I can’t remember films I saw or most of what I thought of them. I’ll keep writing them, but they are unlikely to appear anywhere public online.</p>

<p>Next up, I rather like these vaguely connected posts. A chance to brain dump things that are semi-related in my head gives the site some consistency (in the weakest sense of that word). So, expect posts to be collected together as they make sense to me. This might mean a more bursty post rate (5 in 5 days, followed by a weeks silence).</p>

<p>Random links have recently moved to the sidebar. This change is working and will stay in effect. My concerns with this are the lack of credit for links (backlinks make the world go round) and comments. The former is unavoidable just now, but I think I can come up with some way of addressing the latter; it’s just not trivial.</p>

<p>Around six months ago, I came up with a plan to rebuild VKPS (the site for which Solitude is ostensibly a sidetrack). It never came to fruition due to time constraints. The plan was to bring Solitude and 3 new sites together under some framework. University has to come first, but the first of those 3 sites is set to drop within a fortnight. If I’m being honest, I haven’t done any concrete work for it yet (beyond a dozen scribbled ideas for content). It is likely the release date will falter due to University starting back. I will try though.</p>

<p>Final point: I’m not sticking by any of these. If you disagree (or agree) with anything here, or can think of any other changes, comment. I’m listening.</p>

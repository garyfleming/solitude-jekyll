<h1 class="title"><a href="/Archives/2004/10/09/RockIn3Days/">Rock In 3 Days</a></h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>The lack of updates around here are largely due to a very busy week for me. I’m not going to say too much about why it was busy (as is my tendency to minimise the amount of personal stuff on this site), but I am going to give nods to some of the bands I’ve seen this week (10 in total).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spartamusic.com/">Sparta</a> put in an interesting performance, showing the more balanced side of former band At The Drive-in (while The Mars Volta pushed forward with the more esoteric side). Catchy lyrics meant I had songs stuck in my head days later and had to buy their second album to get them out.</p>

<p><a href="http://yourcodenameismilo.com/">yourcodenameis:milo</a> put on the best visual show, mixing up modern rock with a video show that illustrates the style of all their video and artwork thus far perfectly. Very clean, minimalist artwork that must be a marketer’s dream; pulled off well. Black and white is the new black (not, as some might say, orange jumpsuits).</p>

<p>Who else? <a href="http://www.degrassi.co.uk/">Degrassi</a> showed signs of things to come. If they get signed soon, they will be the next big thing in rock. Although there were some technical difficulties, they made an astounding performance look effortless.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://seafood.uk.com/">Seafood</a> put together the best musical show, going straight from a lengthy piece of intro music into the first song proper seamlessly. The mini-acoustic set in the middle was superb (featuring an acoustic version of normally bass-heavy, chunky propaganda track, Cloaking), and the extended set was appreciated by all.</p>

<p>There were, of course, 6 other bands but they didn’t come close to these 4. All worth a listen if you like various facets of modern rock and indie.</p>

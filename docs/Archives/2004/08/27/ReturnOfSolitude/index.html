<div class="post">
  <p>After a 2 month venture to Nottingham, I’m back. Although it was originally going to be there for a year, I decided that the job simply wasn’t what I wanted to do. I’m unsure about specifically mentioning the company I worked for (very big company, one of the biggest in the world), but for those who know (or can figure out) who I mean I’d like to say that they are a great company to work for and really look out for their people. It just wasn’t meant to be.</p>

<p>Anyway, onwards. Solitude will return with more than film reviews (all I could really get away with posting); there are a shedload of links waiting to be put into a link post, and I’m sure I’ll have a few things to say about tech.</p>

<p>For the moment, let me tell you a few things I’ve learned and realised over the last few months.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beeston, the area of Nottingham in which I lived, has far too many pizza places for them all to stay afloat legitimately.</li>
  <li>Nottingham itself is a beautiful city (even if it does have far too many shoe shops).</li>
  <li>There are so many good bars and clubs in Nottingham, especially for rock fans. I heartily recommend <a href="http://www.cookieclub.co.uk/">The Cookie Club</a> on a Saturday, as well as <a href="http://www.rock-city.co.uk/">Rock City</a>.</li>
  <li>Although I’m a master chef, I hate cooking. Especially in the morning.</li>
  <li>“<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099453983/qid=1093609534/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-4853879-0585203">Diary</a>“, by Chuck Palahniuk, is an incredible read.</li>
  <li>I am a compulsive list writer. Until recently, I had denied and hidden this trait but I have too many lists to continue doing so.</li>
  <li>Anytime I go to London something goes wrong. Every time.</li>
  <li>Art, in any form, is exactly what you take from it. Don’t let anyone, not even the artist, tell you any different.</li>
  <li>Language is fundamentally tied to culture. To truly understand one, you have to grasp both.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mclusky.net/">Mclusky</a> would be the new hotness, if it were not for the fact that they’re not that new or hot. They’ll have to put up with being an outstanding band, with an unrivalled live ferocity and a style that is both comical and stone serious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expect more on some of those at a later date. For now, I’m off to catch up with some <a href="http://iratescotsman.com" title="Matt Gemmel's site">old</a> <a href="http://chris-miller.org/blog/index.php" title="Chris Miller's site">friends</a>.</p>

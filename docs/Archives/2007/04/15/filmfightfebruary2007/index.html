<div class="post">
  <p>Yes, it’s massively late (March should be ready soon), but it’s time for the February Film Fight.</p>

<p>First up is an Academy Award winning performance by Forest Whitaker in the terribly titled <strong>The Last King of Scotland</strong>. The story of a young doctor who wants to see the world, and ends up becoming the personal physician of Ida Amin, the Ugandan dictator. As we see Amin rise to power, Whitaker masterfully portrays the paranoid, capricious nature of the General. A powerful and terrifying movie.</p>

<p>The much vaunted <strong>Babel</strong> ties together four disparate stories, transcending language barriers and racial backgrounds to show us how we’re all the same, or at least that’s the idea. In practice, the links between the stories are tenuous at best, the characters are in bad situations through every fault of their own, and very little can be done to reconcile their general idiocy with any saving graces. Despite the hype, this film is resolutely dull and the plot goes nowhere. The key point should have been a 10 minute short film; at nearly two and a half hours, it is terribly paced. Avoid.</p>

<p>Despite some misgivings about Leonardo Dicaprio’s accent, <strong>Blood Diamond</strong> is a surprisingly good movie. It’s the story of a man caught in the illicit diamond trade in Africa, and those who will do anything to exploit him to gain a precious gem. A very honest, and at times brutal, reflection on the insanity and greed of man. More great performances throughout make this well worth seeing.</p>

<p>I like Michel Gondry. His music videos are great, some of his movies have been genius but, sadly, <strong>The Science of Sleep</strong> is not. It includes his usual mix of oddball characters and usual visuals, which is just fine; we’re happy with visually interesting cinema. What does not work is when you have a lead character who wants to be a playful childish twenty something, but actually comes across as a creepy stalker type. Breaking and entering is not a sign of mental stability, folks. Building out from this guy, there’s nowhere you can really go. A sad mistake.</p>

<p>Since everyone has no doubt seen <strong>Hot Fuzz</strong> I’ll make this brief. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Edgar Wright, ITV drama piss-takes, buddy cop films, and some fairly dark humour all brought together. Genius. Go see.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Number 23</strong> has Jim Carrey in serious mode. After he begins reading a novel he receives as a gift, he begins drawing parallels between his life and the main character, and the constant reappearance of the number 23 in both their lives. The first two acts deal with these coincidences while the final act takes a fairly take it or leave it twist. Not awful, but this film does take a few poor alleys of exploration.</p>

<p>Despite the near non-review, the winner this week is <strong>Hot Fuzz</strong>, though both Blood Diamond and The Last Kind of Scotland would have the weight to win in other weaker months.</p>

<p>P.S. March will appear when I can remember what I saw last month. I didn’t take notes which is making it trickier.</p>

<h1 class="title"><a href="/solitude-jekyll/Archives/2007/06/18/music-subscriptions/">Music Subscriptions</a></h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>I’ve been surprised that no-one in recent years has decided to give the idea of subscription music a serious attempt. By that, I don’t mean the sort of thing that <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">eMusic</a> are doing, where you pay an an intermediary a monthly subscription for a fixed number of downloads from a plethora of artists. In fact, I mean the opposite end of the subscription spectrum.</p>

<p>The way music works most of the time is that a band works on an album, then puts it out along with some singles, and tours it for a year. Then they do another tour with no new released material, have a break, and repeat. The album-tour-break cycle for many bands is 2-3 years, in which the bands have a flurry of buying activity near the start (album release), that rapidly trails off for all but the biggest artists. Although they’ll get royalty cheques through the in-print lifetime of their records, the size of said cheques declines soon after release (unless you’re Nirvana, in which case it gets bigger year on year).</p>

<p>Bands are always going to have a number of hardcore fans who will buy or download anything the band puts out. Albums, singles, b-sides, bootlegged live shows, acoustic tracks, even demos; the biggest fans will lap it all up. I just wonder to what extent bands could utilise that to guarantee a relatively steady income.</p>

<p>How much money do artists generate just now? The album itself is probably Â£10, and the singles are about Â£3 for all 3 formats in a modern release (thanks to deals that people like HMV do). After 3-4 singles, the total amount generated per dedicated fan is around Â£22. (Note: we’ll ignore touring costs, t-shirts, and other merchandise, because that doesn’t change).</p>

<p>Imagine a service where the fans agree to pay an annual subscription of Â£20. For that price, they get access to all the music the band release in that period. If it’s an album year, they get a copy of the album (either digital only, or a real physical copy), and all the singles. If it’s not an album year, they get a deluge of other material: live shows, acoustic versions of favourite songs, demos, maybe the occasional new song too. This is not necessarily a huge amount of extra work for the artists; they’re creating the vast majority of this stuff anyway. They just keep it to themselves, or sometimes it gets bootlegged. Why not make some money from it?</p>

<p>The less astute readers may be thinking, “hold on – Â£20 is less than the Â£22 the band were making beforehand”. You’re absolutely right, it is. But that’s what they’re getting in an album year. Currently, that Â£22 is all they generate from releases for the whole of the 2-3 year cycle. Years 2-3 get them very little. Move to a subscription model, and that’s Â£20 every year, or Â£40-60 for the cycle. A significant increase.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it’s a regular fixed amount of income. If you’re a small and independent band, you no longer have to worry month-to-month about sales: you’ve got at least some portion of it forecast quite nicely.</p>

<p>As I say, the extra material already exists for most bands. Live shows are recorded, acoustic versions exist, and albums get heavily demoed before production. They just have to ensure that they keep a decent and consistent stream of music going to subscribers. That’s an album and singles one year, and a few live shows etc the next. It’s not a big burden.</p>

<p>Another benefit from a label point of view is that suddenly you have a very engaged audience: you have people who are actively waiting for what you will give them. This means you can easily cross-sell similar artists (subscribe to X and Y? We’ll give you 25% off Z), or promote new bands (you like X? Here’s some free stuff by this new band Y who’ll be supporting X on their next tour; if you like it, subscribe with a small discount).</p>

<p>Complications? Of course there are. For example, what happens if a band splits early? You keep the money in a holding account and only pay it out to the band every month or quarter, pro-rata, so you can give it back to the fans if the band falls apart. I think with a little thought, this is a workable system.</p>

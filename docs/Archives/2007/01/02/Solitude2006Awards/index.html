<div class="post">
  <p>Happy New Year to you all. I wasn’t planning on doing a 2006 best of, but when trying to wrap up the year quickly and move on, what could be better? Onwards:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best Album of 2006</strong> – This is tricky as I bought far more albums from prior years than albums actually from 2006. I will probably go for “Mcluskyisms”, the retrospective by now defunct Welsh band, Mclusky. Featuring 3 <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym>s (don’t go for the one disc version) of mad, great rock, you can’t pass it up. I suspect had I gotten the Yourcodenameis:milo collaboration album, “Print Is Dead, Vol. 1”, earlier then it might have stood a chance. If you ignore the awful collaboration with Lethal Bizzle, the rest seems to be gold.</li>
  <li><strong>Best New Band</strong> – This is the best band I heard last year and easily goes to Kinesis. Sadly, they have split but left a masterpiece in “You Are Being Lied To”; sounding like the rock album the Smashing Pumpkins never quite managed. Got their earlier album for Christmas (thanks, Jen!) and that is also sounding pretty good, need a few more listens though. Also quite liking what little I have heard of Piano Bar Fight. Reminds me of the more thoughtful Idlewild moments, with Morrisey like vocals (as distinct from lyrics).</li>
  <li><strong>Worst Split</strong> – I can’t immediately think of any bands that I wished had made at least one more album. I would say Drive Like You Stole It, but they actually split in August 2005. I’m pretty sure I didn’t notice until Spring.</li>
  <li><strong>Best Use of Michael Caine</strong> – Since William Fichtner went to TV this year (only really featuring in the woeful Ultraviolet), the best usage award is for Michael Caine: everyone’s favourite Michael Caine impersonator. This year he actually did some acting! While his character in The Prestige was decent enough, he was delightful in Children of Men as a playful hippie. Really good stuff there from Alfonso Cuaron.</li>
  <li><strong>Best book I read this year</strong> – The sublime Catch 22, by Joseph Heller. While it’s now one of my favourite books, it was a bit of a non-event since it was the only book I read in 2006. Yes, that is an abysmal effort, and one I’ve already taken steps to rectify this year. It’s not that I wasn’t reading at all, just that it was mostly online: thousands of articles, covering technology (of course), neuroscience, cognition, perception, religion, economics (a growing interest), and lots of other bits and pieces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare and contrast with the <a href="/Archives/2006/01/03/Solitude2005Awards" title="the 2005 Solitude awards">2005 awards</a> to realise the world is a very samey place. I will hopefully increase my post count in 2007, after a fairly dry 2006. That’s what we always say though.</p>

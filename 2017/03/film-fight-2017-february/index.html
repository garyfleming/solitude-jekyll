<div class="post">
  <p>February was, as always, a busy month, with the remainder of the Oscar hopefuls getting a release in the UK. That means there are 8 films in this month’s fight.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Lego Batman Movie</strong> tries to take one of the funnier side characters from The Lego Movie and see if he works on his own. While a few jokes get run into the ground, it mostly works. It’s pretty much what you’d expect: enjoyable, silly, fun, with a take on Batman that revels in all of the character’s ridiculous history. Worth seeing, with some decent jokes for older viewers. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/829060419159474176">my The Lego Batman Movie Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Fences</strong> sees Denzel Washington direct himself and Viola Davis in an adaptation of a play about the struggles of an African-American family. The lead performances are excellent, rightly gaining Oscar nominations (and a win for Davis) for their well-delivered, wordy, weightiness. While the film feels very much like the stage adaptation that it is, that never detracts: the tension rises to keep the audience captivated throughout. Intense, and gripping. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/831499047919841282">my Fences Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>After the over-the-top silly action of the original, <strong>John Wick: Chapter 2</strong> is exactly what we wanted: a story crafted around fantastic action set-pieces, in the weird assassin ridden world to which we’ve been introduced. The opening set-up is overlong, but you’ll quickly forget that as we see sequences like the silent subway gun battle. Dumb, but fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/833246232021700608">my John Wick: Chapter 2 Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Though I saw it before the ceremony, <strong>Moonlight</strong>, we now know, won the Best Film Oscar this year, so there’s some pressure on the movie. It starts strongly, following a young, poor, African-American boy struggle with a drug-addict mother, and finding a surrogate father. As the film jumps to various point in the lead’s life, we see him struggle to accept himself in circumstances we don’t often see on film. It’s a good character study, with powerful moments throughout, but is perhaps a little muted and slow in places. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/833752013422862337">my Moonlight Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Founder</strong> is the fairly straight-forward telling of how, thanks to one man’s vision and greed, McDonalds went from a single restaurant to the behemoth it is today. Michael Keaton puts in a fantastic lead performance, with a solid cast around him. The story is well-told, but not spectacular. Decent. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/834477036756410368">my The Founder Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Netflix are seriously upping their Original movies game with several coming out every month that are of note: <strong>I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore</strong> is no different. It’s a strange indie film: a mix of oddball characters dealing with some serious events (and some not-so-serious), filled with dark humour and bloody violence. Well-paced, well-shot, and a lot of fun. Definitely worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/835600271506042881">my I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Imperial Dreams</strong> is the heart-breaking story of a young father struggling to escape his upbringing and poverty, while making sure his young son is okay. At times devastating, the film (and John Boyega’s performance) does a fantastic job of making you feel the awful pressure on the lead. Great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/835600488217391105">my Imperial Dreams Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>A Cure For Wellness</strong> is horror schlock. It’s overlong, and ridden with as many cliches as they could cram in. That said, it works reasonably well: by always going over-the-top, we can’t do anything but go along with the characters as they do increasingly bizarre things in almost surreal circumstances. Okay. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/836291060276084736">my A Cure For Wellness Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for February is <strong>Fences</strong>, as nothing else comes close to the dramatic tension in the scenes of family struggle in this movie.</p>

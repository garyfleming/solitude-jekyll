A mostly very late Film Fight 2016 comes to an end in time. As per [my permanent caveat](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2015/12/31/film-fight-2015-finale/), Film Fight is done in a knock-out style: it'll let me select my favourite film of the year, but with no guarantees about second place.

First, the honourable mentions. Films that didn't win their month but were good enough:

* The Hateful Eight
* The Revenant
* Creed
* Spotlight
* Trumbo
* Deadpool
* Anomalisa
* 10 Cloverfield Lane
* Zootropolis
* Midnight Special
* Captain America: Civil War
* Everybody Wants Some
* Star Trek Beyond
* Rebirth
* Arq
* Swiss Army Man
* Mascots
* Nocturnal Animals
* Before The Flood
* Sully: Miracle on the Hudson
* Star Wars: Rogue One

And now the monthly winners:

* January: **Room**
* February: **Hail, Caesar!**
* March: **High-Rise**
* April: **Miles Ahead**
* May: **Green Room**
* June: **The Nice Guys**
* July: **Born To Be Blue**
* August: **Jason Bourne**
* September: **The Girl With All The Gifts**
* October: **War on Everyone**
* November: **Arrival**
* December: **Bleed For This**

Looking at the winners, most deserve a place with only a few getting very lucky (**Jason Bourne**).

Two biopic films about Jazz musicians (**Miles Ahead** and **Born To Be Blue**) inexplicably got wins, and both deservedly so. They each deal with addiction and fame in interestingly different ways. Worth seeing.

**The Girl With All The Gifts** is worthy of a special mention: I didn't know what to expect and what I got was marvellous. Incredible world-building, decent action, good performances, brutal moments, and dark humour. If you missed it, it's worth finding a copy when it comes out for a home release next month.

In **Green Room** we got an exciting and well-written thriller, with some unexpectedly brutal moments and Patrick Stewart playing very against type. In **Room** we see a horrific situation played out through the eyes of an innocent child, and then we get so much more. **Arrival** plays with structure in strange ways, revealing a bittersweet and heartbreaking story.

As always, it's tough to pick a winner, especially between Room and Arrival, but I think the best film (though not the easiest watch) is **Room**. Brie Larson absolutely deserves her Oscar for a fantastic and nuanced performance, helping bring out a surprisingly good performance in her child actor counterpart, Jacob Tremblay. Room is horrific and beautiful, and manages to do far more than the premise would seem to allow. A worthy winner.

Boosted by Netflix putting out a heap of Original films, there are seven films in the fight for March.

First up, Logan is the X-Men film we've wanted for quite some time: Wolverine delivering some fairly brutal violence, tempered only by the last vestiges of his conscious. The film isn't just dumb action, though. It's a reasonable look at frailty and the effects of age. It just happens to also be a superhero film that thinks it's also a Western. The last act is a little slow, but on the whole this is a very solid bigger budget movie. Watch.  (See [my Logan Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/840958569621147648))

Burning Sands looks at hazing in college fraternities. Rather than the usual silly comedy, we get to see the more violent extremes and, in this case, through the lens of a Black university pledgee. At times, it finds moments of humour in the pledgees camraderie, but more often we see cost these dangerous practices have on young men. Difficult, but engaging. Worth watching.

Next up, Elle is... well, challenging. Isabelle Huppert's central performance is stunning, and without the film would likely fall apart. The rest of the material is controversial and often hard to watch, dealing pointedly with subjects that are usually dealt with differently. Almost two months on, and I can't honestly say I enjoyed it as a whole but it certainly made an impression. (See [my Elle Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/841735243275096064))

A huge December this year, with seven films...

First up, Bleed For This is a story you've seen before many times: a brash boxer in his peak gets unexpectedly knocked down a few rungs, and has to overcome overwhelming odds to get back on top. That said, this film is done well enough, with strong enough performances, that you won't really mind. Aaron Eckhart, in particular, is great as the coach in this drama, based on real events. It's not doing anything new, but it's done it well. Worth seeing. (See [my Bleed For This Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/805085470396911616))

Allied sees Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard team up as World War Two infiltrators who fall in love, but is this just a long game by the enemy? You probably won't care too much. The tension being built up never works, mostly because their chemistry seems fairly forced. Moreover, the CG is bad enough throughout (from bad lighting to glaring CG objects) that it'll distract if you have even the slightest eye for these things. It's fine, but forgettable.

Tom Hanks rarely fails to give a great performance and he doesn't fail in Sully: Miracle On The Hudson either. The true story of a pilot who, seeing his passenger plane fail, decided to take the risky option of landing on the Hudson River. He saved every passenger. The narrative structure here is splintered, showing the post-mortem investigation, the crash, and many other points of view, as a way of showing his fractious state of mind after the event. It's straightforward, but well-paced. Decent. (See [my Sully: Miracle On The Hudson Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/808019193182425089))

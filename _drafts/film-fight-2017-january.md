Another year, and a new Film Fight. As usual, January is a busy month with seven films in the fight.

First up, Assassin's Creed is one of the greatest films based on a video game ever created... which is to say it's terrible. The lead performances are reasonable enough, but almost everything else falls flat. The plot is barely coherent, which is surprising given how much exposition there is in the dialogue. The action is boring, and the secondary characters aren't remotely interesting. A bad story told poorly.

Martin Scorsese has been thinking about making Silence for decades, so it comes with weighty expectations. Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield are excellent as the Jesuit priests send to a hostile Japan to find their old mentor. The film looks incredible throughout, setting the mood as cold and isolated, emphasising the priest's loneliness and tortured mindset. The last act is excellent but might not be worth the long, slow grind to get there; the film feels every bit as long as it's lengthy runtime would indicate. Okay.

Ben Affleck directed films have been worth seeing but his latest, Live By Night, is not. A gangster story with cliched characters, the film never manages to make us care about the lead. The pacing is slow, the writing is all exposition, and, honestly, it's more than a little dull. Avoid.

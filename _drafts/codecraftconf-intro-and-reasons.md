In September of last year, I helped run a software craftsmanship conference called CodeCraftConf, as an extension of a montly meetup we had run for two years (CodeCraft).

We knew that we wanted the conference itself to reflect the ethos of the meetup: it would be software craftsmanship-focussed but, more importantly, it would be about people speaking to their peers. With one exception, our meetup had shyed away from speakers and tried to keep the focus on working together as a group to help each other either in our day-to-day work or to understand a particular topic. A key part in this was that we, the participants, are all in it together and there are no experts preaching from on-high. It would be going against the grain to organise a conference where speakers got the attention of the room for any length of time.

* Welcome
   * Welcome everyone, and thank you for coming to the inaugural CodeCraftConf.
   * CodeCraftConf is a conference by developers for developers where everyone's engagement is key. Rather than receiving information from an expert on a stage, which can be very valuable, we'd like to have hands-on learning and discussion, where we practitioners help each other learn about the topics in which we are interested.

* Fire Safety
   * Before we get into the details, we have some housekeeping we need to do...
   * ??? -- Can't outline this part yet

* Structure
   * There are 3 tracks today: one workshop track and two conversation tracks
   
   * What/why  GuidedConversations
      * The first two tracks will be using a format called Guided Conversations. These are a way for someone familiar with a subject to guide participants in a structured conversation, without leading that conversation. The guides ask a series of time-boxed questions, with each designed to cover the main points of the topic.
      * If all the chairs are taken in a conversation, then it's full, so consider the other conversation or a workshop.

   * Workshops
       * The workshop track has two workshops: this morning we'll be comparing mob programming to pair programming to solo programming, and this afternoon we'll be looking at Clean Code & Refactoring. We would encourage you to try at least one of the workshops.
       * If you don't have a laptop, we have a few spare.

   * Lean Coffee
       * In the gap between the morning workshop and lunch, we also have a lean coffee session for you to discuss any topics you would like.

  * Breakout
      * If, for any reason, you need some time away from conversation, there is a small breakout area towards the back. Feel free to use it.

   * Food/breaks
      * As you'll see from the schedule, there are plenty of opportunities for additional conversation during the day.
      * Coffee and water will be available throughout the day. Lunch will be served at 1pm in the beer hall area, where the workshops are being held.


* What do we need from participants?
   * A guided conversation is only as good as the participants, so we encourage you to contribute to the conversation as well as listen to others.
   * We're not here to win an argument either; we're here to learn and explore the topic, and help others to do so.
   * We also prefer staying engaged in the conversation to attempting to document the event so please stay in the moment
   * We discourage you from using your phone, tweeting, or taking photos. Instead, listen closely and contribute when you can.
   * One other factor that can adversely affect considered conversation is alcohol consumption. We trust everyone to act reasonably and responsibly.

* Respect
   * Finally, there is a code of conduct - we expect people to abide by it.
   * The main points from that are:
      * We are a harassment free conference. The organisers will take whatever action they deem necessary to stop any harassment that takes place.
      * No arguments directed at people - only at ideas and opinions.
      * Listen to the whole of other's thoughts - don't just run over your response.
      * Respect the group's time - Keep comments concise and clear, so others may respond.
      * If someone disagrees, evaluate both positions. Being open to disagreement, rather than being defensive, of your own opinion is key to conversation.
      * Everyone is responsible for following these rules, and should help uphold them where they feel able to do so.
   * If you have an questions or concerns, please contact one of the organisers.

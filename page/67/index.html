    <p>While, like any knock-out tournament, the film fight format cannot create a ranking for the films I’ve seen this year, it can show one thing (and only one thing): my favourite film of the year. Here are the finalists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team America: World Police</li>
  <li>Million Dollar Baby</li>
  <li>The Life Aquatic</li>
  <li>The Assassination Of Richard Nixon</li>
  <li>Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy</li>
  <li>Sin City</li>
  <li>War Of The Worlds</li>
  <li>The Wedding Crashers</li>
  <li>Land Of The Dead</li>
  <li>A History Of Violence</li>
  <li>Saw 2</li>
  <li>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, those are some fairly excellent films (except Hitchhiker’s and War Of The Worlds, which won by default), and that’s leaving aside stuff that would have shined elsewhere (Batman Begins was out the same month as Sin City and there was little in it, for example, or pretty much everything in October).</p>

<p>So from the list of finalists, remembering that some better films never made it to the final twelve, the best film of this year is…</p>

<p><strong>The Life Aquatic</strong>. While both Sin City and Million Dollar Baby nearly had it, the performances and perfect comic moments in the Bill Murray film take it into the lead. Quirky, but brilliantly so. Every scene adds a little more to the overall charm. A good winner.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Given that a new year is almost upon us, I figured it is a good time to get rid of the feeds I do not read any more. Before this cull, I had 218 feeds in Bloglines. That’s a fair number to keep up with and I don’t think my unread items count has dropped below a thousand in months now. Here’s what has been removed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/">Scary Duck</a></strong> – It’s not gone any worse, it just hasn’t changed at all. I just don’t read it any more.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://queryletters.blogspot.com/">Query Letters I Love</a></strong> – Not entertaining enough any more for the throughput.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp">New Urban Legends</a></strong> – Debunking urban legends. Good reference, but not feed worthy.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/">World Wide Words</a></strong> – Why I ever subscribed to this is beyond me. Resolutely dull.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/?rss=">Code Snippets</a></strong> – When most of the examples are so out of context and badly done, I don’t want to sift through them in a feed reader for the few gems.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://muttawa.blogspot.com/">The Religious Policeman</a></strong> – A well meaning site on the situation in Saudia Arabia, but one whose jaded writing has become more and more stilted.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a></strong> – A signal to noise problem: not consistently interesting enough to read.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050812.html">Astronomy Picture Of The Day</a></strong> – Although some of the pictures can be quite stunning, there are only so many nebulas I can find interesting. That number was reached some time ago.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/0,6961,603247,00.html?gusrc=rss">Guardian Unlimited</a></strong> – Again, a signal to noise issue. Of the several hundred items a week, I read maybe 2. Time for it to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Far more than that shall be going, but it’s a good start.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2005/12/29/filmfightdecember2005/">Film Fight: December 2005</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>For the final film fight of the year, we have a fairly forgettable bunch, with one stand-out exception among the mediocrity. Despite this lack of greatness, we shall continue.</p>

<p><strong>Doom</strong> has been a long time coming, with the rights being moved around for years. Was it worth the wait? As expected, no. It’s a terrible and utterly mindless film that both misses the point of the game and pads the storyline out with some horrible faux-science. Despite some previously inspired roles, such as in the otherwise awful Be Cool, The Rock is dire; playing entirely to type, in the most unconvincing manner. Expect all the worst Hollywood action cliches. Do not see this.</p>

<p><strong>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</strong>, on the other hand, is surprisingly great, despite the awful trailer and eyebrow raising cast. A modern pastiche of classic noir private eye films, this film manages to raise some laughs with an expertly done take on the classic stereotypes of the genre: our hero gets beaten up constantly, the icey cool PI is gay (groomed, not camp), and the sultry lady involved in the whole affair will, and does, sleep with anyone. Throw in a slightly surreal, but well-executed, plot, some moments of inspired comic genius (the corpse in the shower), and some finely pitched characters and you’ve got a hit. Very good film.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t expect a documentary about the mating rituals of a kind of penguin to get an international release but, due to the American Christian right insisting it is proof of the existence of God, it did. Leaving aside the questionable reasoning in that assertion (to me, it suggests the opposite), <strong>March Of The Penguins</strong> is an okay film. It does exactly what it says it will and no more, and that’s fine; the life cycle of the Emperor Penguin is complex and interesting. Despite this, the cinematic release is fairly unwarranted. It does nothing more than any other nature documentary and suffers when compared to other films.</p>

<p><strong>Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe</strong> is part of the classic series of books once turned into a kids TV series by the <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym>. This big-budget interpretation is quite different, sticking slightly closer to the books in tone, but losing character for it. The Christian allegory throughout the series is front and centre here, where the televisation kept it roughly in the background allowing it to shape events from there rather than saturate the story. There is, of course, nothing wrong with such allegory (the well-meaning lessons therein are to be commended). However, the manner in which they are handled seems fairly superficial and forced, as if someone read an essay on the meaning of the book before touching the screen play. While it is essentially a good kids film, it is nothing particularly special. Shame that.</p>

<p>Though a lot of noise has been made about this film of the musical of the classic Mel Brooks’ comedy, <strong>The Producers</strong>, the simple fact of the matter is it just isn’t as good as the original. That’s hardly suprising given how excellent that film is. What is surprising, however, is the terrible job that several of the main characters do. Matthew Broderick is the key failure here, with a characterisation both one-dimensional and crudely developed. He isn’t the only problem, with lacklustre performances by many. The pacing is wildly off as well. The climax of the film’s central play is easily a crescendo, followed by too many acts of plodding around wrapping up the story. While this is obviously necessary for the film to make sense, it’s handled in such a dull manner as to drag far longer than it should. Pedestrian, at best.</p>

<p>It should be fairly clear from that lot that the December winner is the fantastic Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. With a winner for every month of the year, it’s only a day or two until the Film Fight Finale (who didn’t see that coming?) where the best film of the year shall be revealed.</p>

    <p>It seems that the excellent <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18122005/325/jcb-song-powers-its-way-top-charts.html">Nizlopi have gotten to number one</a>. I implore everyone to go and buy a copy of this tomorrow to ensure they get the Christmas number one.</p>

<p>I saw them play in Edinburgh a few months back when I went to see their support band for the night, <a href="http://www.amplifico.net">Amplifico</a>. The show they put on is quite unlike anything else, with a double bass, beatboxing, rapping, and folk music mixed together. After that, go seem that play at King Tuts in January (or wherever your nearest venue on their tour is).</p>

<p>Buy it!</p>

    <p>I came across <a href="http://blogs.iloha.net/ryochiji/" title="Ryochiji's Blog">Ryochiji’s</a> interesting new blog-matching site called, surprisingly, <a href="http://blogmatcher.com/">BlogMatcher</a> (via <a href="http://www.mrry.co.uk/">mrry</a>). It indexes blogs that ping <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a> and finds similarity in links. You, the imaginary user, then come along and give it a blog to find matches for. It then provides you with a list of similar sites.</p>

<p>Most of <a href="http://blogmatcher.com/j.php?url1=http%3A%2F%2Fsolitude.vkps.co.uk">my BlogMatched sites</a> focus on <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and other similar issues; not surprisingly, considering how tired I am of writing that acronym – really need to automate that. There are a few entries on random stuff (<a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030506232303" title="Review of X-men 2">Halle Berry</a>, <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030503234319">Dreamcatcher</a>, etc) as well.</p>

<p>Also, I hate <a href="http://www.blogshares.com">BlogShares</a>. I started playing a month or two ago for 10-15 minutes a day; slowly amassing money. And then I bought into <a href="http://omor.com/b/">FSP 1.1</a>. Shares bought at $15.63 have dropped to $0.81, scrubbing $800 from my pockets. DAMMIT! Oh well, I made a grand on another site overnight so karma balanced.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been reading about <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=892542">Uberman’s Sleep Schedule</a> – a way of hot-wiring your brain into allowing 2 hours sleep a day. I don’t think I could make it work just now (where could I sleep at university every 4 hours?), but might experiment a bit during the summer.</p>

<p>There was more, but it’s gone for now.</p>

    <p>Further to my post about <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030509234103">Content Sent Correctly</a>, I’ve been added to Evan’s list of sites that pass all 3 tests called “<a href="http://www.goer.org/Markup/TheXPhiles/">The X-Philes</a>“. So far, only 11 sites are on that list.</p>

<p>What I didn’t mention before-hand, is that there is actually a 4th test: Why do you use <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>? So thought it might be worth answering that one, even if it isn’t necessary.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>To learn</strong> – the best way to learn a new technology, for better or worse, is to use it in a practical application. For XHTML, that means building a website,</li>
  <li><strong>Because XHTML is <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym></strong> – I like XML. It’s well-formed, logical, and if something isn’t how you wanted it to be, it’s probably your fault (rather than a browser bug, as is usually the case in <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>). It’s also scrappable. If I want to extract any part of my markup without going to stupid lengths, I can do so with any XML parser,</li>
  <li><strong>It’s semantically richer</strong> – no more name tag, only one language attribute, and lots more redundancy is gone.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m sure there are other reasons that I’ve forgotten for now, but I think those are sufficient reasons.</p>

    <p>The single greatest innovation of recent times: <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/crawl.php3">automated pub crawling</a>. Just give it some location data (post code, or city name) and it’ll generate a random pub crawl for you to go on. It changes every time, so the alcoholics (read: students) out there will never get bored. Isn’t technology wonderful?</p>

    <p>A few days ago, I read about a test someone was doing on various sites. The <a href="http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/Apr/index.html#29">test showed</a> that of 119 sites tested, only 1 site had fully conformed to <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>. So, I wanted to see if this site passed the tests.</p>

<p>The first two were easy: every page on this site validates as XHTML 1.1 (or it damn well should). The last one was a known problem: sending the pages you read as <em>application/xhtml+xml</em> rather than <em>text/html</em>. So off I went to find a solution.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before I found <cite>Mark Pilgrim’s</cite> <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/19/dive-into-xml.html">Road To XHTML 2.0: MIME types</a>, which included a trivial piece of <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> that would solve my problems. It was quickly added to my headers.</p>

<p>Now, this change to my PHP meant that browsers who could accept the correct MIME type got that sent to them, others (like <acronym title="Internet Explorer/Windows">IE/WIN</acronym>) got a normal MIME type that wouldn’t strain them.</p>

<p>Everything was going fine until I had to edit a post (I never spell-check this until well after entries go online). The editing feature of my <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> bawked at the new MIME-type. Why? Because browsers refuse to display any XHTML in a textarea when you use the proper MIME-type, leaving me screwed since my CMS dumps XHTML straight into a textarea to be manipulated.</p>

<p>After a bit of fudging, it all works. I can hardly wait for a new bunch of problems when <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xhtml2-20030506/">XHTML 2.0</a> hits.</p>

<p><ins>Sorry for how boring this all turned out. I’m a little ill today, and it seemed interesting when I started writing. Oh, how wrong.</ins></p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/05/07/MetaData/">MetaData</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I recently came across the <strong>PostCon format</strong> (an <acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym>-based format) in a <a href="http://burningbird.net/articles/monsters1.rdf">document describing an article on monsters</a>. Take a look at it: that’s a lot of metadata! It got me thinking: how much metadata should we store on a given article?</p>

<p>The Finetto <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> format is very small, but also in its early unsettled days (Finetto is the content management system I use and build). The elements are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ID</em> – a unique ID for each article, derived from the time it was written,</li>
  <li><em>Title</em> – the title of the item, not necessarily unique,</li>
  <li><em>Date</em> – The date the article was created. This is a throwback to when I didn’t understand how to use event-driven parsers properly, and has always annoyed me,</li>
  <li><em>Description</em> – A short description of the article, entered manually,</li>
  <li><em>Author</em> – Name of the person who wrote the article. This appears automatically (taken from a users log-in), but can be entered manually,</li>
  <li><em>Content</em> – The content itself as a chunk of <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, compared to PostCon, that is tiny. But there are times when I wish I had stored category information, or used an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>-like format, or even scrubbed the date (it can be taken from ID). The question is should we attempt to store all information that could possibly maybe be useful down the line? I’m not convinced either way.</p>

<p>On one side, you’ve got the benefit that if you ever need to know anything about the document, it’s right there: no need to infer it from other sources (the web page that the article appears on, for instance). But, on the other side, you also have a tremendous amount of bloat if the data is never used. If a post is small, the metadata outweights the data which strikes me as horribly wrong.</p>

<p>When I can get a clear path to backwards-compatibility, I’ll seriously look at getting a lot more metadata into my format. For now, I’ll just muse over how much is enough.</p>

    <p>I hate seeing those “Sorry, I haven’t been posting much” posts, so it’s with more than a little trepidation that I write one myself to try and explain my two and a half month absence. (I am, in truth, adding this entirely for my own benefit years down the line.) The following things have happened:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I left my job at the BigCo I’ve been working for since I graduated from university (3+ years of service). There wasn’t any big, deep disagreement, I just felt it was time to try something different and take on a different kind of challenge. I’d certainly go back at some point in the future, if that’s where my path was headed.</li>
  <li>Consequently, I’ve started working for a pretty SmallCo. So far it seems pretty excellent, and is a remarkably different kind of pace. The amount of bureaucracy has decreased dramatically, but the level of support for peripheral items has also decreased. All in all, it seems like it’s a good experience and one I should be taking at this point in my life.</li>
  <li>I’ve moved flat <em>again</em>. Yes, this is my 4th flat in 3 years, but hopefully the last for a good little while. I’ve finally left the city centre of Glasgow behind, and am slowly getting acquainted with the south side (specifically, Mount Florida).</li>
  <li>As I mentioned on <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming">Twitter</a>, I was briefly admitted to hospital after my appendix decided it wanted a separation. It was a tough break-up but a few weeks later, I think I’m over it.</li>
  <li>Aside from that, I’ve been catching up on various games. My Guitar Hero skills are coming along nicely, and Fable II was quite a nice diversion. Fallout 3 is just warming up now.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to say that it won’t happen again, but we all know it will. I do, however, have a reasonably large selection of ideas that I want to write about in the near future so hopefully it’ll be a little less barren here. Look out for the remainder of 2008’s Film Fights, and the Film Fight Finale in the next few days.</p>

    <p>Any time, after a little to long on a branch, that I go to merge back to trunk, I seem to forget the magic steps involved in making this easy. For my own reference, tag the head of the branch and then:</p>

<p>`</p>
<pre>
svn log http://example.com/url/to/branch --stop-on-copy 
</pre>
<p>`

&#8230; will get us the revision that the branch happened from. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s 27101.


`
<pre>
svn diff -r27101:HEAD http://example.com/url/to/branch --summarize
</pre>
<p>`

&#8230; will let us know of all the files that have changed between that revision and the head of the branch.

Then you&#8217;re free to take a trunk check-out and do a merge with full knowledge of what&#8217;s happened.

  <div class="post">
    <p>Unlike last month’s quiet patch, this month there are 6 films to take in.</p>

<p><strong>The Wackness</strong> is about a teenage drug dealer and his psychiatrist becoming friends and going over the edge. The relationship that grows between the two leads is well handled, seeming genuine for the most part, but the same cannot be said for the somewhat forced love story between the teenager and the psychiatrist’s daughter. The dialogue throughout is excruciating (it’s supposed to be the nineties, so we get all kinds of street lingo), but there are some true horrors uttered between these two. Ben Kingsley excels as the psychiatrist but away from that there’s just not all that much to see here. A fairly average film.</p>

<p>The lack of decent US horror movies continues with the amazingly lacklustre yawn-fest, <strong>The Strangers</strong>. There’s nothing new or particularly well-done about this movie, taking in an alone-in-a-cabin plot and eventually getting to a pretty weak torture set-up towards the end. There’s little to like here, with the only notable moments being the (predictable) arrival of a familiar face going wrong and some of the character set-up in the first act. After that, it was uninspired drudge.</p>

<p>Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have made another great comedy in <strong>Pineapple Express</strong>, the story of a dealer and one of his customers (Rogen) who are forced to go on the run after witnessing a brutal murder; not the most obvious set-up for a light and wacky comedy. The writers largely avoid a lot of the more obvious and moronic drug references and instead get into some great dialogue (Danny McBride has some of the best lines) and over-the-top, violent, physical comedy. It looked like the trailer would have the majority of the scenarios in it, but this is not the case, with near enough end-to-end laughs. A great (if not classic) comedy.</p>

<p>It’s courted a lot of controversy for it’s use of Robert Downey Jr. doing a minstrel show and the heavy mocking of the mentally handicapped, but can <strong>Tropic Thunder</strong> deliver as a comedy? The answer is: not particularly. Sure, it has some very funny moments (Downey Jr. provides most of these, with Danny McBride again bringing impeccable timing) but the whole thing feels quite like a place-holder. The plot is there to hold together some scenarios they writers had built up, but doesn’t tell a compelling story. In the face of the far superior Pineapple Express, this suffers as another cheap-and-easy comedy. That’s not to say it lacks any merit, but it’s not a first choice.</p>

<p>Could a fascist (autocratic) regime rise once again? That’s the question that German-film, <strong>The Wave</strong>, asks. Based on a required reading book in Germany, the story is that of a teacher who, during project week, builds a cult to show that anything is possible if you’re not careful. We see a wide range of points-of-view, from the outraged to the the subsumed, all of which add a little extra. It’s got a strong message, but falls down on depth: there are too many ideas here and not enough time to develop them, and those previously mentioned views don’t go into as much detail as we might like. Ultimately, it’s a good movie, but could have done with a bit of script editing to give it cleaner focus.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Taken</strong> is a fairly simple movie done extremely well. A man, who we soon learn is an extremely well-trained solder/agent, finds that his daughter who is holidaying in Paris has been kidnapped. Despite a fairly simple progression (the man hunts his daughter’s kidnappers in as vicious a manner as you can imagine), it’s surprisingly good. We see some excellently choreographed fight and action sequences, we see some well-directed and succinct storytelling, and just enough background for it to be somewhat believable. An over-long ending and odd pop singer subplot aside, this is a lean cut of action-thriller. Very good.</p>

<p>The winner for September is a bit of a toss-up. Pineapple Express is excellent, but I think <strong>Taken</strong> is slightly stronger, though both are very good in their respective genres</p>

    <p>Yes, it’s quite late again, which is surprising given there are only three films. Let’s see how they get on.</p>

<p>First up is <strong>Get Smart</strong>, the story of a bumbling agent in a hand-wavingly explained government spy agency. Ostensibly a comedy, the director manages to fumble the fundamentals with the film suffering from poorly explained sequences, predictability, an over-reliance on slapstick and poor stereotypes. There are funny moments in there (such as the brief fighter jet segment) and the cast (the otherwise excellent Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin) do their best, but there’s simply not much here. A shame.</p>

<p>Shane Meadows has created some of the finest moments in recent British cinema, from Dead Man’s Shoes bleak and grimy revenge story to This Is England’s look at hooliganism and growing up around the wrong people. Unfortunately his run seems to have run out with <strong>Somers Town</strong>, the story of a boy who has run away to London and befriends a Polish immigrant. Ignoring the pretty obvious shoe-horning of adverts into the work, the plot and characters really lack any depth. The relationships seem hollow and forced, and nothing comes across as natural. Worse, the story really doesn’t go anywhere, with a painful happy ending tacked in rather than dealing with any of the issues raised early on. Had the film focussed on the relationship between the Polish boy and his father, and their lives in London, then maybe it could have done something, but this cut shows the film as shallow; a real pity.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Step Brothers</strong> sees Will Ferrell reunite with collaborator John C. Reilly as two 40-year old brats who still live with their now-married parents. The problem here is that there are very few jokes or funny moments and they almost all extend from this one premise, making the film feel a bit of a one-note wonder. Sure, there are some very funny bits (the wife of Ferrell’s brother is particularly good) but there’s also a lot of dead weight and barely thought out ideas. Still worth seeing, but not up to previous films that duo have worked on together.</p>

<p>So, it’s a bit of a weak recommendation but the winner is <strong>Step Brothers</strong>.</p>

    <p>Only 4 films this month:</p>

<p>First up is Frank Darabont’s take on Stephen King’s <strong>The Mist</strong>. Amongst filmed versions of King’s work, it ranks amongst the most subtle and controlled pieces. Rather than explicitly showing everything that happened (creatures coming from another dimension and covering the world in a deep fog) and giving us another brainless monster/horror piece, Darabont has focussed on the real heart of the story: the tension between believers and non-believers, through a fairly cunningly chosen bunch of set-pieces. Slowly, different fears and prejudices seep through a group trapped in a supermarket until they inevitably turn on one another. The way this is done is masterful, and the climax is pretty heartbreaking, cheapened only slightly by an unnecessary denouement. The characters themselves are fairly one-dimensional, but that’s the point: they’re only aspects of ourselves. Very strong, subtle film-making, though perhaps a shade on the long side. Recommended.</p>

<p>Jack Black continues to dominate Hollywood, moving into animated shenanigans with <strong>Kung-Fu Panda</strong>, the story of a martial arts-obsessed panda who becomes entangled in a years old grudge match to become the best at kung-fu. It’s happy enough, has plenty of laughs, and neat pieces, but is let down by a fairly mediocre performance by the titular character. Black is doing a watered down version of his normal schtick, without really emoting. He’s a great presence, but not much of a voice actor. Still, there’s enough in the film to make it watchable and even enjoyable.</p>

<p>Pixar, on the other hand, are a powerhouse of animated movies and their latest release, <strong>Wall-E</strong>, is no exception. This story of a lonely robot and his first love is set against the backdrop of environmental disaster, and humanity’s laziness. Suffice to say it all works out the way you’d expect, but the story is still worthwhile. More interesting is the style in which the story is told: almost no dialogue, beautiful animation and lots of brilliant realised characters. While it doesn’t go into great depth on any of the key themes, something that is to be expected from a kid’s film, it is a great story and well told. Another hit for Pixar.</p>

<p>Finally, Christopher Nolan continues to redefine the superhero genre in <strong>The Dark Knight</strong>. I’ve discussed this film more than any other in recent memory and I agree with the pervading feeling: it’s extremely good. Heath Ledger is incredible as the Joker, the tone is well set, the cinematography is exceptional, and it’s a thoroughly enjoyable film. That said, it’s not without flaws. Most notable is the burgeoning length and lack of clear focus. Building up Harvey Dent for the fall to become Two-Face was necessary, but then cramming so much of the character into the back half of the movie? It felt forced and pushed the film longer than it could comfortably sustain; that strand could and should have been picked up in the next part of the series. There’s plenty of other cuts that could be made: most of the cast being rendered mere scenery compared to the scene-stealing joker. I could go on (and have in conversation) with list of problems with the movie, but ultimately I enjoyed it, and thought it was a compelling piece of film-making. I recommend it highly.</p>

<p>I’m a little torn for this months’ winner: should it be a subtle horror movie, a brilliant but light story, or a flawed but enjoyable blockbuster? They’re all great films, but I think it’s going to be <strong>The Dark Knight</strong>, largely due to Ledger’s perfectly-pitched attempt at the classic Joker character.</p>

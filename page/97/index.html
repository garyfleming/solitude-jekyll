  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/09/27/hero/">Hero</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After having the martial arts aspects of <strong>Hero</strong> trumpeted, and knowing there was a strong cast (Jet Li and Tony Leung et al), it was with some doubt that I went into the film; it couldn’t possibly be as good as people said.</p>

<p>One word: beautiful.</p>

<p>Truly a film that uses the medium to its fullest potential. Care has gone into every leaf, the colour of every rock, the splashes of water, and the wardrobe. It is not just the still imagery that is stunning, the kinetic effects are also perfect; water, the breeze, limbs. Harmonious.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the film is without faults. The story was somewhat lacking and the fight on water scene did nothing but be silly (yes, it’s ballet, but a poor one).</p>

<p>Those weaknesses do not remove from the visual splendour of the film, and the enjoyment derived simply by watching.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/09/26/Dodgeball/">Dodgeball</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Surprisingly, <strong>Dodgeball</strong> is amusing. It is dumb but, as with many Ben Stiller films, that is entirely the point. All the usual plot features can be expected: the main character learns an important life lesson, the losers become winners, the guy gets the girl, and some rather tasteless jokes.</p>

<p>The mark for these sorts of film can largely be determined by how many memorable lines and moments there are (I’m sure that we can all still remember the best ones from <strong>There’s Something About Mary</strong>). This has enough to make it amusing. That’ll do for me.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/09/26/TheTerminal/">The Terminal</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p><strong>The Terminal</strong> is bad. Very bad. Tom Hanks is pitiful, the story has become generic Hollywood tripe (despite being an interesting premise), and Zeta Jones plays one of the least developed characters of modern times (“Hi! I’m simply here to move the plot on very slightly”).</p>

<p>Utterly without merit.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/09/22/collateral/">Collateral</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>In a move that will shock all right-minded cinema goers, Tom Cruise is bearable in the movie <strong>Collateral</strong>. More than that: he’s actually pretty damn good. Playing the confident straight forward killer seems to be a role that he was made to play, pulling it off with a degree of style that gets you on his side.</p>

<p>The film itself is the tale of a fairly ordinary cab driver who, upon accepting an all night fare from Cruise, begins becoming more and more unstable as events unfold.</p>

<p>Tightly shot, well paced and Hollywood dialogue at a minimum, Collateral is a very pleasant piece of cinema. Kudos.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/09/19/Anchorman/">Anchorman</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>If you haven’t realised by now, <strong>Will Ferrell</strong> is a God. Outstanding timing and the kind of naive dumb act that makes the sides tremble as if the largest feather in the world had just been purchased and was heading for your feet. From this modest start, throw in some seventies cheese, unexpected violence, a tight script and quirky supporting cast, and you have the beginnings of a legendary film.</p>

<p><strong>Anchorman</strong> is that film.</p>

<p>I’ll say no more because I wouldn’t want to ruin a single character or line from it. Hilarious from the start to the end of the credits (don’t leave until the very end).</p>

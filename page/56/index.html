    <p>Apologies for any recent feed problems you’ve been experiencing. As part of an effort to try and consolidate all my feeds (about 6), I’ve decided to outsource the URL to something a bit more permanent, in the form of <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>.</p>

<p>There was a rather silly problem with cyclical redirects, but it’s all sorted now. I advise that you change your subscription to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/solitudevkps">Solitude FeedBurner Feed</a>, if your feed reader of choice has not already done so.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2007/04/15/filmfightfebruary2007/">Film Fight: February 2007</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

    <p>Yes, it’s massively late (March should be ready soon), but it’s time for the February Film Fight.</p>

<p>First up is an Academy Award winning performance by Forest Whitaker in the terribly titled <strong>The Last King of Scotland</strong>. The story of a young doctor who wants to see the world, and ends up becoming the personal physician of Ida Amin, the Ugandan dictator. As we see Amin rise to power, Whitaker masterfully portrays the paranoid, capricious nature of the General. A powerful and terrifying movie.</p>

<p>The much vaunted <strong>Babel</strong> ties together four disparate stories, transcending language barriers and racial backgrounds to show us how we’re all the same, or at least that’s the idea. In practice, the links between the stories are tenuous at best, the characters are in bad situations through every fault of their own, and very little can be done to reconcile their general idiocy with any saving graces. Despite the hype, this film is resolutely dull and the plot goes nowhere. The key point should have been a 10 minute short film; at nearly two and a half hours, it is terribly paced. Avoid.</p>

<p>Despite some misgivings about Leonardo Dicaprio’s accent, <strong>Blood Diamond</strong> is a surprisingly good movie. It’s the story of a man caught in the illicit diamond trade in Africa, and those who will do anything to exploit him to gain a precious gem. A very honest, and at times brutal, reflection on the insanity and greed of man. More great performances throughout make this well worth seeing.</p>

<p>I like Michel Gondry. His music videos are great, some of his movies have been genius but, sadly, <strong>The Science of Sleep</strong> is not. It includes his usual mix of oddball characters and usual visuals, which is just fine; we’re happy with visually interesting cinema. What does not work is when you have a lead character who wants to be a playful childish twenty something, but actually comes across as a creepy stalker type. Breaking and entering is not a sign of mental stability, folks. Building out from this guy, there’s nowhere you can really go. A sad mistake.</p>

<p>Since everyone has no doubt seen <strong>Hot Fuzz</strong> I’ll make this brief. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Edgar Wright, ITV drama piss-takes, buddy cop films, and some fairly dark humour all brought together. Genius. Go see.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Number 23</strong> has Jim Carrey in serious mode. After he begins reading a novel he receives as a gift, he begins drawing parallels between his life and the main character, and the constant reappearance of the number 23 in both their lives. The first two acts deal with these coincidences while the final act takes a fairly take it or leave it twist. Not awful, but this film does take a few poor alleys of exploration.</p>

<p>Despite the near non-review, the winner this week is <strong>Hot Fuzz</strong>, though both Blood Diamond and The Last Kind of Scotland would have the weight to win in other weaker months.</p>

<p>P.S. March will appear when I can remember what I saw last month. I didn’t take notes which is making it trickier.</p>

    <p>If you’re wondering why I’ve been so quiet here (and on <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming">my twitter</a>) it’s because I’ve been quite busy elsewhere. I won’t bore you with the details, but I will say that the silence will continue for a short while as I will be moving house at the end of the week. As always with these things, it will take a few weeks to get a phone line and internet access sorted.</p>

    <p>Is anyone else who uses <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> noticing an odd problem with items being kept new despite not having appeared before?</p>

<p>I’ve noticed that, on the Digg feed in particular, as I scroll through several items out of the hundreds have already been marked as “keep new” despite me having never seen them before. Is this a known bug?</p>

    <p>I have signed up to <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, partly prompted by <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt</a>‘s invite, and partly because it seems like a good place to dump those really short thoughts that I think about blogging but then feel guilty about passing them off as real material here. I’ll integrate it into the sidebar at some point (sometime 2008 at this point), but for now if you want to see it you can find me at <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming">http://twitter.com/garyfleming</a>, as cunning a name as you might imagine.</p>

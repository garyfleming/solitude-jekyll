    <p>I tweaked my <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/UgcRss/">UGC <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed creator</a> to include a few cinemas that I apparently missed. It should now cover every UGC cinema in the UK and Ireland. While I was at it, I also added information about the director and actors in each film to the description (if you want a plot synopsis, just follow the link on each item).</p>

<p>I also was about to change the mime-type from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text/xml</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application/rss+xml</code>, but to do that I’d need to generate a link to the feed, rather than take the user straight to the feed. This is, of course, pretty easy to do. Unfortunately, I’m knee deep in coding something else, so it’ll have to wait.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/08/29/JustConfidence/">Just Confidence</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>The thing about most polished twisting films is that the twists have become far too cliched. <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0310910/"><strong>Confidence</strong></a>, starring Ed Burns and Rachel Weisz, is one such film.</p>

<p>The plot isn’t important here, it’s more the predictability that should be focused on. If you’ve seen a few films like this, you’ll know what to expect. Con artist gets himself into a jam, gets himself out of jam (almost), things seem to go horribly wrong, it was all part of the real plan that’s been hinted at all along. Yawn! By now, we all know that “throwaway” dialogue in these films is usually an indication that something important is going on. Same with various framing techniques. If you ever see an actor giving an over the shoulder look, think carefully about what’s going on.</p>

<p>So, maybe doing some media studies ruined this film for me, maybe it just wasn’t a great film. Either way, I’m sick of seeing predictable twists. Get some real imagination, Hollywood; surprise us all.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/08/26/GivingtheUGCRSSfeeds/">Giving the UGC RSS feeds</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I was at the UGC website the other day, looking at the listings for my nearest cinema for the billionth time this month. I suddenly had the thought that it would be great if I could get the show times in an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed. Every day I could see what films are on, and what times they’re showing when checking my email and other RSS feeds.</p>

<p>So I checked the website. Unsurprisingly, they don’t provide any. The only way to get an RSS feed was to do it myself; my first adventure into screen scraping.</p>

<p>Now, screen scraping is a technique that is notoriously difficult to get right and keep right. It also doesn’t help that there aren’t any good tutorials on the subject (expect one soon). The basic idea is to look at a webpage and systematically grab the bits you want.</p>

<p>Long story short: the <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/UgcRss/">UGC Cinemas RSS feed creator</a> is a way to generate an RSS feed for any UGC cinema in the UK. All comments are welcome, all feedback too.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/08/25/americanwedding/">American Wedding</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’d almost forgotten that I’d gone to see this, so I’ll keep it brief. <strong>American Pie 3: The Wedding</strong> (or one of the other various names I’ve seen it called – some too vulgar for a family publication) isn’t great. That would’ve been obvious to anyone who has seen either of the first two.</p>

<p>The thing is, it’s also not absolutely terrible. Even those most hardened against gross out comedies will be pressed not to laugh at least once.</p>

<p>Sure, some of the characters were entirely unnecessary with a handful of lines during the whole film, others had been changed to more suit the mob perception of them. It was, however, still funny in places.</p>

<p>Go see it? Maybe. There’s no rush to do so, but it is a slow week for cinema… So why not?</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/11/06/aliendirectorscut/">Alien: Director&#8217;s Cut</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The new director’s Cut of <strong>Alien</strong> is as chilling as the original: full of bizarre organic architecture, aliens that just work, and the single greatest use of sound effects in cinematic history. The film is great. See it.</p>

<p>However, the particular showing I went to was not so great. About half an hour into it, the film stopped playing, the lights went up and the adverts they show during cinema dead time (usually slides) started showing. Many people were confused and annoyed. A few minutes later, it restarted; having totally killed the tension that had been building up.</p>

<p>Another half hour later, someone in the second row’s phone went off. He let it ring a good 6 times before answering it. By answering it, I don’t mean that he switched it off embarassedly. No, he had a bloody conversation. If he had gotten the beating that so many of his fellow audience members obviously wanted to give him for being a “twat”, he would have sorely deserved it.</p>

<p>I’m of the understanding that this happens on a semi-regular basis in cinemas in America, but it’s the first time I’ve ever seen someone answer their phone here (and I go weekly – you might have noticed the reviews). Believe me, if it escalates, their will be violence.</p>

    <p>I’m in awe at how simple and powerful <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">Stuart Langridge</a>‘s new script is: <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">Sortable Tables</a> is a javascript that does exactly what it says (an attribute I like in scripts), it sorts tables.</p>

<p>The code is clean, fast and, from what I’ve seen, widely compatible. Nicely done.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Just before <strong>Matrix Reloaded</strong> came out, I made far too many posts about it and the rest of the Matrix universe (Animatrix, comics, propaganda etc.). After the mild disappointment of the film, I’m loathe to do it again for the third cinematic installment. I’ll be going to see it tomorrow (the day of release) but not at the first showing, as I had hoped. Oh well.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know (have you had your head under a rock?), Warner Bros are releasing the film simultaneously around the world; same day, same time. Thankfully, while Los Angeles will be getting it at the insane time of 6am, here in the UK it starts showing at the more reasonable 2pm.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Some were billing it as Macaulay Culkin’s comeback, it’s not that. Some said it was a work of comic genius, it’s not that. Some said… Let us just say that a lot of people have said a lot of things about <strong>Party Monster</strong>. I’m going to say very little more.</p>

<p>It’s not very good. By that I mean, and please excuse my use of our robust language here, it is utter shite. It’s written in such a way as to alienate the audience from the characters, making it rather difficult to care when things go wrong. Sure, there are some funny moments, but they’re only moments; seconds that die off as quickly as they arrived, leaving you just as cold to the characters.</p>

<p>I could say more, but I think everyone has said enough.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/08/02/film-fight-2015-april/">Film Fight 2015: April</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>

  <div class="post">
    <p>April is a little quieter, with just three films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck</strong> is a documentary that covers the early years of Cobain’s life, through his success with Nirvana, his relationship with Courtney Love, and ultimately his death. It starts off strongly, by showing a side of the icon that we rarely see, his formative years, in such a way that we both get insight into and sympathy for his later struggles. There are powerful moments throughout the piece, but the presentation is somewhat lacking. Lengthy montages over Nirvana songs make up the bulk of the piece, and these are the weakest segments by a long way. It works far better when it’s being a more traditional talking-heads documentary. Languid pacing ultimately ruin an otherwise interesting take on the man. Mediocre, meandering, maybe dull. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/589374007255965696">my Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Keanu Reeves has a reputation for being a little wooden as an actor, and <strong>John Wick</strong> does very little to shake that, even amongst a movie full of forgettable performances. The story is pretty weak, and the world building is a mess, but it does have some fairly spectacular action sequences. The action choreography works extremely well, stylised and efficient gun play throughout. It’s fun but absolutely mindless. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/589374556000878592">my John Wick Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Avengers: Age Of Ultron</strong> gives us exactly what we now expect from these films: a large ensemble (including some newcomers), fight against a huge threat (in this case, the titular Ultron, played well by James Spader), in a series of increasingly large scale battles. It’s a high quality blockbuster action film with everything that implies. It’s polished, fun, exciting, but very much of its genre. If you like the rest of the Marvel canon then you’ll know whether you want to see this; it’s not the best in the franchise, but it’s certainly not the worst. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/591688035554750464">my Avengers: Age of Ultron Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for April is <strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong>. It wouldn’t win in a stronger month, but I’d watch it again long before seeing the other two films.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/07/27/film-fight-2015-march/">Film Fight 2015: March</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For March, we have five films to review…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Predestination</strong> is that rare film that does far more than the description. The synopsis suggests a time travel plot about catching a mysterious bomber before he strikes again. The actual plot is very different, but to speak about it would spoil some of the surprises. Obviously made on a lower budget, the film manages to fit in a remarkable amount of world and character building, with striking visuals and genuinely unexpected twists. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/573616217455468545">my Predestination Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Catch Me Daddy</strong> is a dark and provocative look into so-called “honour killings”. While the details of the plot are best watched, it’s fair to say the film progresses slowly and grounded firmly in a realistic style, giving a sense of grim menace. Despite the pacing, the film is gripping throughout. The performances are, for the most part, understated, but that feels right given the subject matter. Worth seeing, but not easy going. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/573616553754779649">my Catch Me Daddy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Neill BlomKamp’s latest, <strong>Chappie</strong>, manages to further erode the stellar reputation the director set up with his debut, District 9. The plot is thin and limp, telegraphed from the outset, and with little originality on display. Despite a great cast, the performances from the traditional actors are bare, and those by Die Antwoord (who make up the emotional core of the movie) are atrocious; consisting of either flat line readings or one-note, overwrought depictions. You won’t care about what happens to anyone. It’s an awful film, avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/577184129646772224">my Chappie Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>If you’ve ever seen a con-man film before then <strong>Focus</strong> will have few surprises. Expect the usual breezy dialogue, heavy use of narrative exposition (usually explaining the next con), and twists-upon-twists that you can see coming from the outset. That’s not to say it’s a bad film: it’s entertaining and competent, if a little predictable. Fun, but far from essential. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/579625240046747648">my Focus Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Voices</strong> is about a man whose dog and cat speak to him, and encourage his better and worse natures. The film takes sharp turns between comically overdone violence and brutal, gritty realism, which greatly helps amp up the dark humour. Ryan Reynolds does well as the lead (as well as providing the voices for the dog and cat), and the remaining cast fit nicely around his increasingly strange behavour. Weird, but funny. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/583001189375049731">my The Voices Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for is <strong>Predestination</strong>. Despite me trying to avoid saying anything too substantial about the plot, it’s worth seeing.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/05/29/film-fight-2015-february/">Film Fight 2015: February</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>February is a lot shorter than <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2015/05/26/film-fight-2015-january/">January’s behemoth edition</a> with just 3 films.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Jupiter Ascending</strong> has some stunning visuals. If you took the Wachowski’s latest film as a series of isolated moments, it can be absolutely striking. Sadly, those moments are tied together as a film; and a terrible one at that. The plot is nonsensical, largely told in exposition, and with characters for whom it would be a stretch to call them “sketched”. Some of the devices and ideas tying the world and action together are beyond dumb, the gravity skates being a particular low point. This film is awful, and I’d wager a contender for worst film of the year. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/565270106692128769">my Jupiter Ascending Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Selma</strong> is a fresh take on the American civil rights movement, focussing on the period Martin Luther King took his campaign to Selma, Alabama. It’s a fascinating insight into both a small moment of the movement, and does a reasonable job of showing that King was a visionary but not perfect. David Oyelowo puts in a fantastic performance as the lead, demonstrating King’s well-known oratorial prowess, and some of his frailties. At times the swelling music and sweeping visuals can be a little on the Oscar-bait side, but this is a movie worthy of that grandeur. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/568684692842651648">my Selma Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Kingsman: The Secret Service</strong> is the kind of big, silly, fun, comic-book chaos that you expect from a Matthew Vaughn film. Sure, it doesn’t quite make sense, and some of the action is a little more chaotic than clear, but it’s entertaining. It’s not going to win any awards, but some films don’t have to in order to be enjoyable. Good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/568685264396267520">my Kingsman: The Secret Service Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Fairly easy but deserving win for <strong>Selma</strong> in February.</p>

  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>Welcome to Film Fight 2015! I haven’t checked to be certain, but I believe this is going to be the biggest month yet with 9 films in the fight. Even the thought of tackling this number has delayed this post by a silly amount. Because this was during the season for Oscar releases, most of these are going to be better than average.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Big Hero 6</strong> rightly makes a big deal of the main character’s robot, Baymax, and his understated and unintentional humour. He’s a great addition to an otherwise barely sketched cast of characters, none of whom get enough individual screen time to get beyond a single character trait. I’m not expecting nuance, but a little more than we get would be nice. That said, the film is the kind of fun adventure we’ve come to expect from Disney Animation Studios. It’s certainly not the best kid’s animated film you’ll see, but it’s far from the worst. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/552032691391315968">my Big Hero 6 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>St. Vincent</strong> has Bill Murray play a grouchy but funny old man, a role with which he has become more than comfortable. Keeping the act fresh is the introduction of a single mother and son as neighbours who begin to rely on him. All of the characters build just enough, their interactions work very well, and the movie ticks along nicely. A funny, and at times sweet, comedy. Well worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/554739681494319104">my St. Vincent Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Taken 3</strong> is the next inevitable cash grab in the series, following the surprisingly great original. There’s nothing new here, and many of the ideas have been done to death. It’s formulaic, but fun; entertaining, but with an utterly nonsensical plot. The action set pieces that we’re always moving towards are reasonable enough but you won’t care about any of the cast, making those sequences fairly hollow. Watch if you want something mindless. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/554740268696887297">my Taken 3 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The relentless pace and movement given to <strong>Birdman</strong> by both its seamless editing and direction define it. There’s no looking away from Michael Keaton’s lead performance as an actor losing himself to self-doubt and self-obsession, a nihilistic narcissism played out between stage performances. The supporting cast are equally brilliant, particularly Edward Norton and Emma Stone, each bringing their own distractions. We’re never allowed to see what is real and what is imaginary, where the play within the movie ends and the lead’s breakdown begins. An excellent movie. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/554741451155070976">my Birdman Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Foxcatcher</strong> is based on the true story of a millionaire funding wrestling in the US, for mostly vanity reasons, and the two brothers who get caught up in his ill-conceived act of egotism. The lead performances are exceptionally strong. Steve Carrell shows a serious side we haven’t seen before, and Channing Tatum puts in a great physical performance as an awkward, lumbering wrestler. As a whole, however, the movie is languidly paced. Until the very end, you want things to move just a bit faster. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/557302240973946880">my Foxcatcher Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Never before has musical performance been so tense as in <strong>Whiplash</strong>. I can think of few films that had my muscles tighten so much as when the lead, an aspiring drummer, performs as hard as he can whilst being berated by his bully of a coach, fantastically played by JK Simmons. As you might imagine, the film sounds incredible, one of the few times going to the cinema pays dividends unless you have a high-end sound system. The story itself is weak (you’ll see most of it coming) but it’s the two thoroughly unlikeable main characters going head-to-head that make this film something you. Excellent. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/557304314595917825">my Whiplash Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>There are many war films that have something to say that would be worth hearing. <strong>American Sniper</strong> is not one of them. Its few messages (the impact of war on veterans, the unflinching/harmful patriotism of some) have been said far better in other movies. The plot itself, focussing on a sniper chasing one of his counterparts over the years, is dull: each of the four main segments are similar enough that even the few action sequences are pretty unengaging, with the only stand-out being the scene used for the trailer. Not worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/558025475411705857">my American Sniper Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>I have a lot of time for James Franco and Seth Rogen. Their comedy is often juvenile, but it frequently tickles me just the right way. <strong>The Interview</strong> is not one of those occasions. The premise is thin, the jokes are one-note (and it’s a dud), the progression is contrived, the acting is weak, and there’s really not much else. It fails to do just about anything well. There are a million better comedies to see than this. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/559074371961372672">my The Interview Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Ex Machina</strong> is a fascinating and gripping take on some very important issues. It’s an exploration of AI, human nature, and manipulation. There are enough twists and turns, layers of complication, to keep things moving nicely. Alex Garland has shot this beautifully, squeezing surprisingly great and nuanced performances from his small cast. This is an exceptionally good movie, directorial debut or not. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/561164586259603456">my Ex Machina Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>There are at least three movies that could win the year this month, but only one gets through. Very hard to call, but I think it has to be <strong>Birdman</strong>, for keeping up that pace and quality for so long.</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Yes, most of the Film Fights this year were terribly late, with roughly half showing up in December, but we got there in the end. So what was the best film of the year? As always, <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2013/12/31/film-fight-2013-finale/">my caveat from earlier years applies</a>: Film Fight is done in a knock-out style and, as such, only picks my favourite film of the year; there are no guarantees about second place.</p>

<p>First up, the honourable mentions; the good films that, for some reason, did not win their month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>American Hustle</li>
  <li>The Wolf of Wall Street</li>
  <li>Inside Llewyn Davis</li>
  <li>Dallas Buyers Club</li>
  <li>The Lego Movie</li>
  <li>The Double</li>
  <li>Only Lovers Left Alive</li>
  <li>Zero Theorem</li>
  <li>Under the Skin</li>
  <li>Starred Up</li>
  <li>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</li>
  <li>The Raid 2</li>
  <li>Frank</li>
  <li>X-Men: Days of Future Past</li>
  <li>Edge of Tomorrow</li>
  <li>Guardians of the Galaxy</li>
  <li>Interstellar</li>
  <li>Snowpiercer</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the monthly winners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong></li>
  <li>February: <strong>Her</strong></li>
  <li>March: <strong>The Grand Budapest Hotel</strong></li>
  <li>April: <strong>Calvary</strong></li>
  <li>May: <strong>Blue Ruin</strong></li>
  <li>June: <strong>Fruitvale Station</strong></li>
  <li>July: <strong>Boyhood</strong></li>
  <li>August: <strong>The Rover</strong></li>
  <li>September: <strong>Before I Go to Sleep</strong></li>
  <li>October: <strong>Gone Girl</strong></li>
  <li>November: <strong>Nightcrawler</strong></li>
  <li>December: <strong>In Your Eyes</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It was an uneven year, but it started incredibly well. January, February and March were absolutely rammed with great movies, where the mid to end of the year were a lot weaker. Looking over the winner’s list, though, and they’re all strong contenders (but not classics).</p>

<p>The moods evoked by <strong>Before I Go To Sleep</strong>, <strong>Her</strong>, <strong>Blue Ruin</strong>, <strong>In Your Eyes</strong> and <strong>The Rover</strong> were all affecting in very different ways. The dark humour in <strong>Calvary</strong> and <strong>Gone Girl</strong> hit perfectly, with some lovely direction in both. The real-life inspired <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> and <strong>Fruitvale Station</strong> showed up awful, brutal moments of humanity. <strong>The Grand Budapest Hotel</strong> was another strikingly shot and wonderful Wes Anderson film. <strong>Boyhood</strong>, while not the most gripping story, was a fascinating cinematic experiment.</p>

<p>However, the winner for 2014 (not by much) was <strong>Nightcrawler</strong>. The lead performance was a career best that no-one saw coming (the bit parts are all strong too), it’s cleanly shot, and is a very dark, satirical statement on modern journalism that never missteps. A great film.</p>

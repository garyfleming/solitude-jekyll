    <p><strong>Anger Management</strong> is an ok film – worthy of the few juvenile laughs it gets – as long as you can ignore the ridiculous yet utterly predictable plot, and realise that <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sandler,Adam">Adam Sandler</a> is far from a character actor. Or even an actor. Would I recommend you go see it? No. Wait for it to go to video. Or TV.</p>

    <p>Got a <acronym title="Net MiniDisc">NetMD</acronym> 707 or 505 player? Really desperate for the additional features found in the MZ-N1? Well, thankfully, it will cost you nothing. I recently found a site detailing how to hack the <acronym title="Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory">EEPROM</acronym> to re-enable the nicer features. So if you want to <a href="http://www.dalartworks.co.uk/bhangra/hack_minidisc.php">hack your MD</a> then follow that link.</p>

<p>I can confirm that it does work on the 707 (v1.3), and assume it works on other versions as well. It’s worth it for the adjustable speed alone.</p>

    <p>Never has there been a truer word spoken than this <a href="http://www.nothing-sacred.net/articles/3/321/">article on mobile phones</a>. I have to agree with the punishments for those using mobiles in public in an inconsiderate manner, especially the last one.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Yesterday, I bought <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com"><strong>The Animatrix</strong></a> on <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> (for the very good price of £12). So, finishing off where I started with my <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030517231828">Animatrix Preview</a>, here are short snippets on the remaining parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kid’s Story</strong> – Tied in loosely to Reloaded, this is how Kid (the boy who bugs Neo in Zion) escapes The Matrix. It’s got a very visually pleasing style: a dynamic liquid form of anime. Good, and slightly revealing.</li>
  <li><strong>Beyond</strong> – A haunted house story set in the matrix. Blends traditional japanese anime onto subtle 3D backdrops, with slightly westernised characters. Not the best of the bunch, but certainly not the worst.</li>
  <li><strong>World Record</strong> – A story about a sprinter who, through sheer determination, starts to push his way back into the real world. I can’t describe how the characters look very well: they’re bizarre, without being too deformed or quirky. Interesting statement on the human spirit.</li>
  <li><strong>Matriculated</strong> – A group of rebels set out to teach a machine why the way is wrong, and to convince it to join their side. Standard anime in the real world, but an abstract Tron-like view in the construct (albeit more colourful).</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend the bundle to anyone, even just for Program (the best part).</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/05/SixDegreesDownhill/">Six Degrees Downhill</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It was bound to happen at some point. <a href="http://www.crummy.com/devel/downhill/">Downhill</a> is a way to automate six degrees of separation between blogs. And it works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>For anyone who has never heard of six degrees of separation, it’s where you try and find links between 2 things (people, actors, websites) via links between other similar objects. It’s hypothesised that, by following links from one object to another, you can get from any object to any other object in 6 steps or less. The idea works very well.</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider the case of people: finding a connection between person A and person B, who have never met. Person A, in their lifetime, has probably met thousands of people (take time to think about how many people you’ve spoken to in your life – it’s probably huge) who have, in turn, met thousands of others who have met thousands of others etc. By following the links from person to person, we find that we can get to person B in 6 steps or less, no matter who person B is.</p>

<p>If you add more people to your universe of possible people, you do <strong>not</strong> increase the number of links taken to go between people. In fact, you likely decrease the number of links (since more people means more connections).</p>

<p>Back to the original point, Downhill does an admirable job of find the shortest path between two sites, given its dataset. Plus it has the bonus of providing an <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> to the <a href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/ecosystem/">blogging ecosystem</a>. I think that might come in very handy later on.</p>

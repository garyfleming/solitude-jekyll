    <p>I’m back from a good weekend at <a href="http://www.tinthepark.com"><strong>T In The Park</strong></a> (but the inevitable write up of that will come later – tomorrow or the next day, maybe). Doesn’t seem like I’ve missed a lot.</p>

<p>There’s some fighting going on over Mark Pilgrim’s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/ww">Winer Watcher</a>. I can’t be bothered going into the politics of this thing since I’m still tired, but it’s a long running mess that just keeps getting worse.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, <a href="http://blog.tom.me.uk/2003/07/14/looking_ahead_to_css3_part_1_the_outside_pseudoelement.php">Tom Gilder outlines the ::outline pseudo selector</a>. Since <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>3 is still at the working draft stage, I’d never heard of it before. If it works as advertised, we’ll all be able to get rid of a <em>lot</em> redundant markup and create better looking sites. That’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>That’s about it. I’m off for a needed rest.</p>

    <p>Once again, I’m leaving for a few days. This time I’ll be spending my weekend at <a href="http://www.tinthepark.com">T In The Park</a>. Yeah the line-up is the weakest in years, but it should still be good.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ll be back on monday.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>In <strong>Charlies Angels 2</strong> the action is weak, the plot laughable, the acting below par, the costumes skimpy (not necessarily a complaint), the plot devices clumsy and obvious, the comic relief inappropriate, the serious parts funny, the funny parts serious, the direction distracting, the music editing outright aggrevating (and I liked a fair few of the songs), the dialogue as weak as it comes… I could go on but I think you get the idea.</p>

<p>Money was thrown at this film. Marketing everywhere, and it still sucks. Thus proving that money means nothing in the world of cinema. Except that a million people will still go and see it because they’ve been told to. Shame.</p>

    <p>Have they made upgrading <a href="http://www.php.net"><acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym></a> easier without telling anyone? Last time I attempted it, it took an hour of fiddling with ini settings and my apache config to get precisely nowhere. I did a rollback immediately.</p>

<p>Yesterday, however, I dropped in 4.3.1, modified 2 ini settings and was done in less than 5 minutes. Majorly impressed by how it has smoothed out.</p>

<p>In other news, the first beta of PHP 5 is out. Looks like a lot of improvements to the class structures (private and protected methods and values, abstract classes) and not a lot else. Still, worth watching.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/07/09/PieBeerAndTextile/">Pie, Beer And Textile?</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>First up: How do we feel about <a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.ls-la.net/">99 bottles of beer in 571 languages</a>? Programming languages. Yes, someone has created a list of very similar programs in pretty much every language that’s ever done anything useful (and about 550 others). Too much spare time, but interesting to compare syntax nonetheless.</p>

<p>We now have Necho support in the <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/">feed validator</a> (formerly the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> validator). It is based on the 1st of July snapshot and, although there have been changes since then, it works nicely.</p>

<p>Most exciting for me is the <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/739/">announcement of Textile 2</a>. Textile is an integral part of my developing <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> these days (I even have written permission from <a href="http://www.textism.com/">Dean Allen</a> to include it in any final public release I might make).</p>

<p>There were a few things I had to change about the first version: it got a bit scatty for me when dealing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">del</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ins</code> tag, and refused to do the right thing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> tags without a fair amount of mucking around. I also really wanted a detextile function for editing and began work on it before giving up. At a glance in the code of Textile 2, there seems to be an experimental version in there. Nice! I look forward to being able to mess around more with it.</p>

    <p>It’s not that <strong>Bruce Almighty</strong> is a particularly bad film, it’s not. It’s not even that <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Carrey,Jim">Jim Carrey</a> places the same character that he has in every other film he’s been in (barring <strong>The Truman Show</strong>). It’s not even that the assumptious preachy content is overt and irritating… Actually, maybe it is.</p>

<p>As with all slapstick comedy, it’s funny in places and sure to make most people smile at some point. But you won’t be quoting lines from this in a years time, or even a week. Comedy-lite: As a sandwich, compared to something like <strong>Wayne’s World</strong>‘s steaky goodness.</p>

  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve added a few new syndication formats today, thanks largely to the fact that the generic feed creation script I wrote last week actually works. So what are these fun new flavours of syndication?</p>

<p>First up is <a href="/Syndication/Epistula.esf">my <acronym title="Epistula Syndication Format">ESF</acronym> feed</a>. This is a very simple format: date, title and link all in plain text. And that’s it. <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/article/name/esf">The ESF spec</a> explains everything you need to know.</p>

<p>Secondly, is <a href="/Syndication/ChannelDefinition.cdf">my <acronym title="Channel Definition Format"><acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym>F</acronym> feed</a> for <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> users only (after the enhancements users of better browsers get, it’s the least I could do for those poor people still suffering a slow bloated browser). Click on the link to the feed and it’ll try to add itself to your favourites. Let it. This will then give you a list of all the current items.</p>

<p>A little bit more difficult to implement. I basically copied the format used by <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net">Sam</a> and <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com">Aquarionics</a> and did my best to get it to work. The only thing that wasn’t fairly obvious was that it must be served with a MIME type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application/cdf</code>.</p>

<p>Both feeds, and others, can be found on <a href="/Syndication/">the syndication page</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/30/CascadingChanges/">Cascading Changes</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve made a few small changes over the past week or so that should make reading this site a bit easier:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Justified text</strong> – text on all pages is now justified. This took a seconds worth of work and makes everything look a lot better. To anyone who doesn’t do this already, add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p {text-align: justify;}</code> to your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Smaller CSS</strong> – The remaining CSS has been made more detailed, yet the file is smaller. If you’re seeing any weird effects during the change, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>F5</kbd> together.</li>
  <li>Valid <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> for code – the code pages now show valid X<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> (where appropriate) rather than the default mish-mish. This is all thanks to <a href="http://www.xiven.com/blog.php?start=26">conversion code from Xiven</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Meta tags changed</strong> – Hopefully Google will actually figure out how to follow my permalinks now that I’ve updated my meta-tags.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with most things, you probably won’t notice most of these changes. That’s a good thing: I like seamless changes.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/29/LastPalindrome/">Last Palindrome</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Ever have one of those zen moments when you see a problem in a perfectly clear way, removing the garbage that you had before? I had one today. It makes my previous effort really quite embarrasing.</p>

<p>I’ve updated the <a href="/Code/Palindrome/">Palindrome code</a> to make it a million times simpler. How did this happen? I was looking at the <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> manual for something entirely unrelated and noticed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strrev</code> function. Everything immediately clicked into place in my head: rather than compare the first and last characters of a string recursively after stripping it down, just strip it down and compare it to its reverse. Simple.</p>

<p>The changes have been uploaded and should have propagated automatically through to the <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/IsPalindromeForm.php">online palindrome checker</a> and <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call"><acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>RPC</acronym> <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> interfaces.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/28/FreshSyndication/">Fresh Syndication</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For the past week or two, the weblogging community has been working on the conceptual elements that make up a well-formed entry for a website (parts that are necessary, and additional elements). Out of this has come the beginning of a new syndication format and editing <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/26/will_the_real_rss_validator_please_stand_up.html">reasons for creating a new format</a> have been discussed elsewhere, with many important people are <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie" title="Tim Bray lends his support to the Echo project">supporting its creation</a>. We’ve got some <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">very smart people working on it <em>full time</em></a> (a big well done to IBM for seeing the value in this project and letting Sam focus on it), and we have a constantly updated <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">wiki for adding to the project</a>. There are literally hundreds of people contributing to it, some a little, some a lot.</p>

<p>What is missing though is a name, a syntax and some real value. The name and syntax are in the middle of being decided on (nothing great so far, and I can only hope that <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/">Shelley</a>‘s suggestion of <acronym title="Personal Publication System">Pubs</acronym> is not used). What we really need is added value.</p>

<p>While I can see the <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/27/NoInventions">wisdom in not inventing anything new</a>, I doubt that a lot of users will. If they have no motivation to use a new format then what makes anyone think that they’ll change. <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> is a widespread format these days and it’ll take more than just being very specific in the specification to actually get people to use it.</p>

<p>Personally, I’ll be setting up a fed as soon as a stable specification is available (I’ve helped mould the project, I might as well use it), but I wonder if others will.</p>

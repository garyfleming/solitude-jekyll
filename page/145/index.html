  <div class="post">
    <p><a href="http://www.themarsvolta"><strong>The Mars Volta</strong></a> brought us the experimental <strong>Tremulant EP</strong> as a statement of intentions for their debut album. They spoke big words through layers of noise orchestrated to perfection: and the album lives up the to promise.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://www.theprp.com/reviews/themarsvolta.shtml"><strong>“Deloused In the Comatorium”</strong></a> borrows much from the bands partial instantiation as the defining moment in rock known as <strong>At The Drive-In</strong>, they’ve taken their previous band’s work and gone off in a tangent as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The result is eclectic, but compelling. You’ll never notice that the majority of the songs break the 6 minute mark (most still going at full pace), it’s that immersing.</p>

    <p><cite>Tim Bray</cite> makes some interesting points about <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/04/Nations">the abstraction of Nations</a>. I can generally agree with him on most of it.</p>

<p>But there’s one thing that I think is important: just because our families and friends are more important to us than our countries, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t contribute to our country as a whole. We should help to make it as good a place as we can, since it is within our reach.</p>

<p>From there, our country (government and national organisations) should help other countries. The notion of “doing good” could potentially be distributed well across this abstraction.</p>

<p>Of course, that’s never the way it works. Maybe it’s late and I’m tired, maybe I’m just dreaming, but maybe we could use these arbitary systems to help others in other arbitary systems.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s not that <strong>Bruce Almighty</strong> is a particularly bad film, it’s not. It’s not even that <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Carrey,Jim">Jim Carrey</a> places the same character that he has in every other film he’s been in (barring <strong>The Truman Show</strong>). It’s not even that the assumptious preachy content is overt and irritating… Actually, maybe it is.</p>

<p>As with all slapstick comedy, it’s funny in places and sure to make most people smile at some point. But you won’t be quoting lines from this in a years time, or even a week. Comedy-lite: As a sandwich, compared to something like <strong>Wayne’s World</strong>‘s steaky goodness.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/07/02/SyndicationToMakeTheEyesBleed/">Syndication To Make The Eyes Bleed</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve added a few new syndication formats today, thanks largely to the fact that the generic feed creation script I wrote last week actually works. So what are these fun new flavours of syndication?</p>

<p>First up is <a href="/Syndication/Epistula.esf">my <acronym title="Epistula Syndication Format">ESF</acronym> feed</a>. This is a very simple format: date, title and link all in plain text. And that’s it. <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/article/name/esf">The ESF spec</a> explains everything you need to know.</p>

<p>Secondly, is <a href="/Syndication/ChannelDefinition.cdf">my <acronym title="Channel Definition Format"><acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym>F</acronym> feed</a> for <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> users only (after the enhancements users of better browsers get, it’s the least I could do for those poor people still suffering a slow bloated browser). Click on the link to the feed and it’ll try to add itself to your favourites. Let it. This will then give you a list of all the current items.</p>

<p>A little bit more difficult to implement. I basically copied the format used by <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net">Sam</a> and <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com">Aquarionics</a> and did my best to get it to work. The only thing that wasn’t fairly obvious was that it must be served with a MIME type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application/cdf</code>.</p>

<p>Both feeds, and others, can be found on <a href="/Syndication/">the syndication page</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/30/CascadingChanges/">Cascading Changes</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve made a few small changes over the past week or so that should make reading this site a bit easier:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Justified text</strong> – text on all pages is now justified. This took a seconds worth of work and makes everything look a lot better. To anyone who doesn’t do this already, add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p {text-align: justify;}</code> to your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Smaller CSS</strong> – The remaining CSS has been made more detailed, yet the file is smaller. If you’re seeing any weird effects during the change, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>F5</kbd> together.</li>
  <li>Valid <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> for code – the code pages now show valid X<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> (where appropriate) rather than the default mish-mish. This is all thanks to <a href="http://www.xiven.com/blog.php?start=26">conversion code from Xiven</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Meta tags changed</strong> – Hopefully Google will actually figure out how to follow my permalinks now that I’ve updated my meta-tags.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with most things, you probably won’t notice most of these changes. That’s a good thing: I like seamless changes.</p>

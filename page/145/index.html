    <p>I apologise to everyone for this post: it is, as the title says, pointless. It’s for me to get a few things down now as a time marker. Feel free to read no further.</p>

<p>Today, I came closer than I’ve come before to getting fired. I didn’t do anything majorly wrong, just a few different small things working against me; mostly out of my control. Although, perhaps it was just unjustified worrying.</p>

<p>Either I’m spending more time online (summer holidays, after all) or people are updating far less (perhaps both), because I go through my rather substantial list of sites to visit every day now; it used to take a fortnight at least, with various sites being visited with varying frequency.</p>

<p>I’ve finally loaded my archive into <a href="http:/www.feedster.com"><strong>Feedster</strong></a>. I don’t think it has been indexed yet though, since I can’t seem to find anything after using lines of text directly from old entries. Oh well.</p>

<p><strong>Thunderbird</strong> is officially a great mail client. It is now my default.</p>

<p>I’m in the middle of redesigning my site and keep hitting walls. I’ve tried art deco style blocks of colour, shades of minty green, and a few other things. They all seem like great ideas in my head, but don’t pan out. Very frustrating.</p>

    <p>Move over, Google! I’ve recently been looking at <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>, and realised how insanely powerful it is. It has a bewildering array of options (thesauras, regex, soundex functions and more), and a highly up-to-date index.</p>

<p>While it’s ranking algorithm might not be as good as PageRank, it certainly makes up for it in the amount of things you can do with it. I hope the <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> documentation goes up soon, I’d seriously consider using it for my site search.</p>

<p>I’ll also soon be loading my entire archive into their system (via <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>), which will make an interesting off-site back-up.</p>

<p>Anyway, good work and good luck to those at Feedster.</p>

    <p>Another reason why web standards should be promoted: a very nice looking <a href="http://moronicbajebus.com/playground/cssplay/top-menu/"><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> top menu</a>, working in all but <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> based browsers. The best part is how beautifully simple the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> is for it. I can also see CSS3 seriously simplifying the CSS.</p>

<p>Definitely a great tech demo, if nothing else. Via <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">mezzoblue</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/07/17/TInThePark2003/">T In The Park 2003</a></h1>

  <div class="post">
    <p>A full write-up of my weekend at <a href="http://www.tinthepark.com"><strong>T In The Park</strong></a> would be huge in length and largely tedious. So I’m going to do this in the shortest style possible:</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The weather – Sunny and bright throughout the weekend,</li>
  <li>Some of the bands – including Hell Is For Heroes, Idlewild, Biffy Clyro, The Mars Volta, The Darkness (entertaining, if musically poor), and Funeral For A Friend,</li>
  <li>The blood red moon on the closing night – worrying, yet cool,</li>
  <li>The good people at Lipton Ice Tea – giving a way a shedload of free ice cold liquid on a boiling hot day marks them as true heroes among men,</li>
  <li>The copy of “Chandelier” I managed to buy after looking for it for a year or two.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The weather – Far too warm for most of the day, the queues for water got to be over half an hour long,</li>
  <li>Some of the bands – including REM, Turbonegro, The Flaming Lips (sorry, but the lead singer was just boring), The Streets, and The Polyphonic Spree.</li>
  <li>The finale by Caledon – embarassing and poorly done,</li>
  <li>The price of food – this was always going to be high, but it was ridiculous.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s bound to be more that I’ve missed, so I might update this entry as I remember.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie">Echo Project</a> finally has a name: Atom. While not my favourite, it’s not as bad as it could’ve been. Some of the names on the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ProjectNameProposals" title="Proposals for naming the echo project">Project Name Proposals</a> are truly awful.</p>

<p>Anyway, at least that chapter is over. We can concentrate on defining the format fully.</p>

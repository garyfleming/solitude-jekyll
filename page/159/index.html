    <p>Given a primary location that is roughly the size of a portaloo, you wouldn’t think <em>“Phone Booth”</em> could be very interesting. Of course, throw in the other key ingredient of the film, a sniper aiming at the occupant of the phone booth who starts picking off nearby people, and you’ve got a considerably more interesting prospect.</p>

<p>The small location doesn’t detract from tension, drama, or even characterisation. We get to see the inner workings of Stu (Colin Farrell), and the mysterious sniper (Keifer Sutherland). Although Stu isn’t the best of people (he’s an asshole), we can still feel for him; trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare, being instructed by a madman who can play God with his life.</p>

<p>I don’t want to say too much more (I try not to ruin films for others), but it’s definitely worth seeing.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Honestly, this’ll be the last “links only” post, I’ll make for a while. I want to get rid of the rest of these before they get too stale (some of them already had to be thrown out because they were getting a bit whiffy).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://w3mix.web-graphics.com/win.php">WTheRemix Winners</a></strong> – The winning entries have been announced in the competition to re-design the <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Homepage</a>. This is badly needed, since the current page isn’t exactly a shining example of what standards can do,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://gtmcknight.com/buttons.html">Web Buttons</a></strong> – Buttons for possibly every conceivable occassion. When I get time, I might contribute a kitchen sink button for completeness,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.disenchanted.com/dis/lookup.html?node=1846&amp;id=FZdYGnqE">Confirmation Bias</a></strong> – This idea occured to me not too long ago: people believe whatever they want to believe, regardless of evidence. The smarter they are, the better they are at defending their own position rather than using their intelligence to be more open-minded. The article does a much more thorough job of explaining it,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="">Better <acronym title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</acronym> links</a></strong> – Just what it says on the tin: links to articles about using better URIs. I’ve also been meaning to start using proper URIs for permalinks on this site, but can’t seem to bring myself to implement it. It’s near the top of my to-do list for the site,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/blog/">Irate Scotsman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/fiona/blog/">Bug’s Blog</a></strong> – While playing around with <a href="http://www.geourl.org">GeoURL</a>, I decided to see who lived within 10 miles of me. I was surprised to find these two: they both go to my university and are in my course. Finding someone I knew (or rather knew of) offline while online was a little disconcerting. I later tried to find more people from my course, but gave up after a grand total of 0 finds. Oh well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said, that’s it for link-only posts for at least, oh, another week.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/04/25/RSSNewspapers/">RSS Newspapers</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p><cite>Don Park</cite> is working on a <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/04/18.html#a422">newspaper <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym> for <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds</a>.</p>

<p>While this is a powerful interface in terms of familiarity and makes an excellent metaphor in terms of gathering news from a global source, perhaps it’s too stylised.</p>

<p>Newspapers cram a lot of information (most of which is filler) into a very small space. The amount of actual amount of raw wanted content by any given reader is minimal (put your hand up if you only read the cartoon strips). The same can’t be said of custom RSS feed generated newspapers. People would only choose to include the content they wanted, so the crowded “interface” becomes slightly redundant.</p>

<p>What might be better is to generate custom web pages based on user templates. I’d rather read content in a web interface that I’ve tweaked for myself than in a automatically generated paper. I know that I’m probably in the minority on that point though, being a web designer does that, but given a reasonable bunch of pre-built templates I can see more users wanting to do this.</p>

<p>Besides, newspaper type-setting (and layout)is an enormously difficult job. People get paid huge sums of money to do it and I don’t think anyone could create an RSS aggregator front-end sophisticated enough to replicate the effect.</p>

<p>But please, Don, prove me wrong. I’d love to see it anyway.</p>

<p>While I’m on the subject, my current RSS aggregator is the wonderful <a href="http://www.methodize.org/nntprss">NNTPRSS</a> which hooks into newsgroup readers. This might not be the best interface for normal web users, but for people who are constantly on usenet then it’s fantastic.</p>

    <p>One of the best ideas I’ve seen implemented in a long time: take the <a href="http://geourl.org">GeoURL tags</a> and the update list from <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>, roll them together in a beautiful flash map, and watch the world update their sites in real-time. This is <a href="http://www.brainoff.com/geoblog/">the world as a blog</a>.</p>

<p>Since I ping weblogs.com and have geoURL tags, I’m going to sit watching the map for the next few minutes waiting for me to appear.</p>

    <p>Apparently, I’ve been using acronyms and abbreviations incorrectly, according to Accessify’s <a href="http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/acrobot/why-you-should-use-acronyms.asp">guide to using acronyms and abbreviations</a>. Before now, I’ve been using acronyms for everything (thinking abbreviations were for thinks like abbr.</p>

<p>Met up with an old friend for lunch today. He’s been away training for the army. Apparently, they’re quite sadistic about punishing people: “Everyone, 20 push-ups! Lipowski’s got his hand on his hip!”. Fun.</p>

<p>I haven’t really been sleeping well for the last 3 weeks. It’s really starting to get to me. Everything is getting harder to remember, details are harder to retain, more difficult to keep thought strands separate, damn near impossible to write anything decent here, emotions are more easily set off. Basically, the works. So if I’m asshole to you or anyone else, I apologise in advance.</p>

<p>And I’ll end with a joke: What’s big, grey and can’t climb trees?<br />
A car park.</p>

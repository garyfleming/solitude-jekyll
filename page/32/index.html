    <p>February’s Film Fight only has two films in it…</p>

<p>First up is <strong>A Dangerous Method</strong>, the story of how the relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, as well as an inappropriate relationship with a patient, shaped the early days of psychoanalysis. Despite some scenes of manic behaviour from Keira Knightley and Vincent Cassel, the strained friendship at the heart of the film just isn’t very interesting. Both men are played in an extremely cold and detached manner, reflecting the analytical nature at the heart of their work. While this may be accurate (I don’t know if it is), it certainly doesn’t make for interesting viewing. As a whole, the film was largely uneventful and dull. Disappointing. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/168766848081473537">my A Dangerous Method Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Carnage</strong> is, at times, amusing and kept interesting by a great cast selection. The four principal actors manage to keep the drama and comedy finally balanced, coming back at each other with the timing that such a play requires. The downside is that the film is very obviously that: a play. By sticking to the conventions of the medium, rather than adapting for film, it has more off-putting stage contrivances than are needed; when the characters start to get drunk within minutes of starting to drink, for example. On a stage, we accept these shortcuts as necessary for putting on the production. On film, they just seem a little lazy. Decent. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/171710624756269056">my Carnage Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>While neither film was great, I think the winner was clearly <strong>Carnage</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2012/02/04/film-fight-2012-january/">Film Fight 2012: January</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A relatively quiet January for once, with just three films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>J. Edgar</strong> is about the personal life (or lack thereof) of former FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover. As well as recalling some of his deeds (and exaggerations about said deeds), it goes to great lengths to show what kind of man he was and why. Paranoid, extremely driven, shaped by his domineering mother, and lacking much in the way of a social life, it’s a sobering picture. Leonardo Dicaprio does an excellent job in the lead role, but is often left working with material that seems extraneous. The final cut is overlong, largely because it remains relatively unfocussed. Many aspects could have easily been removed and a tighter film made. Good, but badly needs editing down. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/161157904995581953">my J. Edgar Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Sitter</strong> is a pretty standard American comedy: a man-boy takes on more than he can/should handle for selfish reasons, and arrives in increasingly farcical situations. There’s nothing surprising or shocking here, but it does manage some good laughs, even if it feels like some of the gross-out moments are shoe-horned in. Sam Rockwell stands out as an unhinged drug dealer, but even he starts to wear a little by the end. Funny, but probably exactly what you expect. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/162082506580033537">my The Sitter Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Haywire</strong> is a spy film with all the usual genre tropes like, double-crosses and a bunch of international locations. The story itself isn’t particularly interesting or well told, and the acting from leading lady, Gina Carano, is pretty poor. That said, the one thing it does surprisingly well is the fight scenes. Not only is Carano convincing when she’s beating up everyone, as you might expect from a former fighter, the direction favours clean and clear shots. No handycam shaking or impossible to follow shots; everything here is about clarity, and it does sacrifice any energy or visual impact to do so. Not a classic, by any means, but the action scenes make it perfectly watchable. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/165212997197897728">my Haywire Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for January was tough to pick, as none of the films blew me away, but I think <strong>J. Edgar</strong> was the best. It’s certainly the film I’d most like to see again.</p>

    <p>Another year, another bunch of film reviews. What was the best of the lot? Settle down and read on to find out.</p>

<p>As always <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2010/12/31/film-fight-2010-finale/">my caveat from previous years still apply</a>: Film Fight is a knock-out tournament and, as such, will only select my favourite film. It makes no guarantees about any other place.</p>

<p>First, the films that were good but did not win their month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The King’s Speech</li>
  <li>Blue Valentine</li>
  <li>127 Hours</li>
  <li>NEDs</li>
  <li>Rango</li>
  <li>Cedar Rapids</li>
  <li>Attack The Block</li>
  <li>The Tree of Life</li>
  <li>Beginners</li>
  <li>Horrible Bosses</li>
  <li>Super 8</li>
  <li>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</li>
  <li>Warrior</li>
  <li>The Ides of March</li>
  <li>Snowtown</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the monthly winners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: Black Swan</li>
  <li>February: The Fighter</li>
  <li>March: Submarine</li>
  <li>April: Source Code</li>
  <li>May: 13 Assassins</li>
  <li>June: Senna</li>
  <li>July: Cell 211</li>
  <li>August: Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes</li>
  <li>September: Drive</li>
  <li>October: Red State</li>
  <li>November: We Need To Talk About Kevin</li>
  <li>December: Another Earth</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there are some great films that didn’t make it through because of a tough month. That said, there’s little slack in the monthly winners. August is probably the weakest of the bunch, but that’s a pretty good average.</p>

<p>Of all the years I’ve done this, I think this year has the most serious contenders. There are at least 5 of those 12 that I’d consider as film of the year worthy, and several more just outside that bracket. Rather than trying to place them all, as I did last year, let me just talk about them in their release order, and figure out a winner at the end.</p>

<p>I’ve long been a fan of Darren Aronofsky’s work, which often picks dark and difficult subjects. It’s probably no surprise, then, that <strong>Black Swan</strong> has made this list. It’s a strange film, in which reality and what passes for reality to the central character are constantly shifting as she destroys herself to pursue her art. It’s difficult to sell ballet to the masses, but Aronofsky does an excellent job.</p>

<p>One of the few foreign language films I saw in the cinema this year, <strong>Cell 211</strong> was a bit of a surprise. I expected it to be an interesting prison drama/action film, and it was, but it was so much more. Following the first day of a guard in a prison, we see the worst of the prison system, and how it changes people. Sure, it does this in a physically violent manner, but just as often we see it in the menace around the lead. Where lesser films would stop, Cell 211 boldly goes further and further. A gripping movie.</p>

<p>Ryan Gosling has really come into his own in recent years. He could take the easy money and churn out some Hollywood action drivel, and become a bigger mainstream success, but instead he’s focussed on making great movies. <strong>Drive</strong> is his best to date. Driving movies have been out of vogue recently, nitro-fuelled nonsense like Fast and Furious aside, so it’s good to see a movie with driving at its heart. It does it scene setting slowly, building a world in which the calmness of the lead is as unsettling as the over-the-top brutality of the criminals. At times, it’s got a magical quality, like the neon tinged city moving to the astounding soundtrack. This is how you do action: build a compelling lead, a tragic situation, paint it with unique touches, and put them all at odds.</p>

<p><strong>We Need To Talk About Kevin</strong>, meanwhile, is like waking from a nightmare. A reasonable portrayal, for once, of the behaviours of a psychopath: a facade of charisma, masking a lack of empathy. It’s extremely difficult to watch, knowing early on what is going to happen, but the constant flips in direction keep pulling you through the difficult narrative. Dark, but very worthwhile.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Another Earth</strong> is full of a tragic beauty. It’s bittersweet, with a haunting soundtrack that pulls you through. I’m going to say the least about this just now, as I wrote my review for it just yesterday. It’s an exceptional film with so very little wrong with it as to not be worth mentioning.</p>

<p>So, a very difficult year. The winner is <strong>Drive</strong>. It’s an action film like no other, a tragic love story in some ways, a western made through a neon veil. A very well deserved win.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/12/31/film-fight-2011-december/">Film Fight 2011: December</a></h1>

    <p>Only two movies for December…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Another Earth</strong> is the kind of movie you never expect and is absolutely one of a kind. It’s beautiful and tragic, melancholy and hopeful, poignant and bittersweet, and otherworldly (both figuratively and somewhat literally). A mistake results in a horrible accident that ruins the lives of a composer, and a young girl. As their lives come closer together, we see the extent to which fate has not been kind to either, and how there might still be a distant hope. The light sci-fi hook is perfectly situated in the background, neither dominating proceedings nor being entirely irrelevant. It’s the gun that will be fired, but for the most part the shot is never seen, just the holes it causes. Stunning, and brilliant. A must see film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/147464114543923200">my Another Earth Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Hugo</strong> is a somewhat disappointing attempt by Martin Scorsese to do a kids film. A few moments set-up as silent movies aside, it lacks the magic and splendour to really pull this off. The pacing is off: the first hour is far too slow to watch as an adult, I can’t imagine any child sitting through it comfortably. The second half is better, but the pay-off we hope for never really emerges. It’s nice, but it’s not great. Sasha Baron-Cohen manages to inject some character as an awkward station guard, but most of the rest of the cast never really do much. The much-lauded 3D in it adds absolutely nothing; there’s little in here to give it any impact. A little slow and disappointing, but ultimately okay. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/149956653205291008">my Hugo Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for December is… <strong>Another Earth</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2011/12/28/film-fight-2011-november/">Film Fight 2011: November</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For November’s Film Fight, there are 3 films slowly fading out of memory…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>We Need To Talk About Kevin</strong> is a relentlessy brutal look at another side of a horror story. We see the after-effects of a high-school massacre from a particularly interesting point of view, who then provides insight into the life of the perpetrator and the effect he had on her life. Tilda Swinton is fantastic throughout, almost unfailingly crushed by her life and left to deal with the consequences. It’s her character’s story, a tragedy that she feels she caused that becomes written through her body and face. The editing is exceptional, delving fluidly through memories and the present (both horrible and mundane) with a fractious momentum. Incredible, moving, and hard to watch. An excellent film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/132210559927070721">my We Need To Talk About Kevin Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>In <strong>The Ides of March</strong>, George Clooney adds another great directing credit to his modest list. The movie has an exceptionally strong cast (Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Clooney himself et al) showing the dark side of politics: continuously spinning the lies and dirt into something that looks better, of strategising and back-stabbing to end in the best position. As you might expect, the cast do their jobs well, and Gosling puts in another top notch performance. Without spoiling anything, the film takes a turn for the dark halfway through, and really comes into its own when we see what each of the leads is willing to do in their own interests. Very good film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/136949691131764736">my The Ides of march Twitter review</a>). Note: as a first, my Twitter review appears to have gone missing. I’m leaving the link in case I ever figure out how to get it back.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Snowtown</strong> is an unsettling look at the true story of Australian’s worst serial killers, and the impact they had on one young man’s life. At times it can be gory, but it’s the pervading atmostphere and stifling control that really bring up a sickening feeling. The naturalistic, sombre direction helps build this awful tension into something unbearable. The ending is very quick, and it would have been better to have seen a little more, but the movie works well. Good, if horrific. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/140554882754154496">my Snowtown Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>This month’s winner is… <strong>We Need To Talk About Kevin.</strong> It’s horrible, but works on every level. A late contender for film of the year.</p>

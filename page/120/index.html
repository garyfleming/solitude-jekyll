  <div class="post">
    <p>Note: There are spoilers in this review, so look away if you haven’t seen it already.</p>

<p>If we’re being honest with ourselves, <strong>Return Of The King</strong> is poor, at best. Sure, the giant battles are impressive as always, but even they seem weak compared to the battle at Helm’s Deep. And the way the battle ended at Minis Tirith? Awful! (“Oh, and then a bunch of ghosts saved the day.”)</p>

<p>The acting was atrociously bad. The hobbits, in particular, were painful to listen to.</p>

<p>The ending was also tediously drawn out. I didn’t think anything would be more dull than the endless walking of <strong>Fellowship Of The Ring</strong>, but the endless ending of Return beat it.</p>

<p>I’m sure that if you like formulaic Hollywood epics then you’ll love this. I didn’t.</p>

    <p>It should be plain that Will Ferrell is a comic genius. It’s a shame that his genius was wasted on <strong>Elf</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s a decent enough film (although it <em>is</em> a kids film), but Ferrell doesn’t shine as he usually does; hampered by an exceptionally stupid character.</p>

<p>There are some great moments, but it could’ve been a good deal better.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>I got a strange email from a company in Kuwait recently asking for a quote on stationary and mobile metal analysis devices. At first I thought it might have been some kind of bizarre spam, but the lack of trying to sell me something I didn’t want suggested otherwise. I put it to one side and forgot about it.</p>

<p>An hour or two later, I checked my referrer log and noticed someone had arrived a day or two earlier from a Google search on “metal analyser”. Performing the same Google search, I figured out what had happened.</p>

<p>The company had seen the <a href="/Code/GenNuMetal/">Generic Nu Metal Analyser</a> in the archives, translated the page badly and thought I was selling metal anaylsers. Whoops, a text analyser was probably not what they had in mind.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/12/26/PolitenessAndAgents/">Politeness And Agents</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Politeness has long been a problem for automated agents on the web. Well, it’s not so much that politeness is a problem; agents are programmed to be impolite, whether accidently or not. Politeness is a solved problem.</p>

<p>Let us be clear on what is meant. “Agents” refers to any automated system capable of talking to web servers, i.e. search engines, aggregators, download managers etc. “Polite” means waiting a while before checking a server again.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a download manager hammers a file on my site 50 times a minute unsuccessfully, that’s impolite,</li>
  <li>If a search agent crawls my entire site, doing so again 4 hours later is impolite. Doing so again <em>every</em> 4 hours is downright rude,</li>
  <li>If an aggregator agent checks my <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds more than 3 times an hour, that’s impolite.</li>
</ol>

<p>How can we solve these problems? As was said earlier, politeness is a solved problem.</p>

<p>However, the <strong>current solutions are poor</strong>. In all 3 situations above, the user of these agents would be banned from crawling the site (either automatically or after manual inspection of logs). “Good riddance,” you might be thinking, “no good bandwidth leech, I’m better of without them.”</p>

<p>Have you considered that the user doesn’t know any better? They don’t know they’re being impolite because so few tools actually <em>tell</em> them.</p>

<p>Download managers: they’ll let you pick any number of connections and any time interval between retries. Would it kill the implementer to bring up a dialogue saying: “This could cause a heavy load on a server, causing you to be banned. Are you sure you want to change settings?”</p>

<p>Search agents: Is it so hard to say: “The time interval you’ve specified between crawls is impolite, and may get you banned and blacklisted. Are you sure you want to keep new settings?”</p>

<p>Aggregator agents: A similar time interval warning to search agents would suffice. As an aside, there is a mechanism in RSS that allows the producer of the feed to <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/">specify a recommended time interval</a> between checks. Do any aggregators support it? Do they tell the end user if they’re in breach of it? Hmmm? Thought not.</p>

<p>If a user doesn’t heed the warnings, ban them.</p>

<p>This puts the pressure on the tool makers to tell users of bad behaviour. And why shouldn’t it be? They should keep their users informed; it’s only polite.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>There are 2 hours or so until Christmas, so I thought I’d better say Merry Christmas to everyone who has ever read this site, to everyone who has left a comment (from some of the comments, it’s apparent that there are people who comment without reading), to all of my friends and family, and those that matter most to me: Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>As a bonus, have fun with this fun <a href="http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/">Make A Snowflake</a> game. There are some jaw-dropping designs in the gallery.</p>

<p><ins>Update: Thanks to the mighty <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a>, you can <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=Merry+Christmas">feel the christmas spirit</a> on a bunch of sites you’ve never been to.</ins></p>

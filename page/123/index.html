    <p>Given that their is a dearth of pictures of me on my site (with good reason), it’s with some trepidation that I link to a <a href="http://iratescotsman.com/images/phonepics/fri-28-11-2003/gary_gmm.jpg">photo of me asleep in a lecture</a>. I feel that it shows off my best features. The photo comes from <a href="http://iratescotsman.com">Matt</a>, who sneakily took it while I was in that particular pose.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>I didn’t go to see <strong>The Medallion</strong> with particularly high hopes. I expected some typical <strong>Jackie Chan</strong> action, with some buddy comedy moments provided by <strong>Lee Evans</strong>. Mindless, enjoyable entertainment.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>It’s an absolutely dreadful film, to the extent that it’s quite amusing. It’s rare that a film manages to be so poorly done, so horribly cheesey, that it gets back to the funny stage.</p>

<p>Plot “twists” and occurences frequently appear from nowhere: the little boy suddenly gains the ability to travel between dimensions at the end of the film (which would have been handy when kidnapped by the evil doers), a plane suddenly appearing at Lee Evans’ house, Lee Evans’ wife having a huge weapons cache (we presume that she is some sort of secret agent, but it is never stated or hinted at), the fact that Jackie seems to be both invincible and immortal despite only having half of the medallion (despite being told something to the contrary in the film). There’s a lot more.</p>

<p>Poor acting, poor plot, no characterisation. All in all a humourously bad film.</p>

  <p class="author">

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After the UGC recently changed their pages to a more irregular format (in terms of code), the <a href="/Code/UgcRss/">screen-scraped <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds</a> I made from them fell apart.</p>

<p>I finally got a chance to have a look at the code tonight and was terrified that it might be part of the main scraping that was going wrong (it’s fragile, very fragile), rather than the postprocessing.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the problem was that rather than leave directors and actor details blank (as previously) they now remove the line entirely. This actually reduces the amount of code I was using to parse out the details I didn’t want.</p>

<p>In short, there was a problem and I’ve now fixed it. Please resume enjoyment of the UGC RSS feeds as long as they last before breaking again (such is the perilous nature of screen scraping).</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The new romantic comedy, <strong>Love Actually</strong>, can be described reasonably accurately in terms of the dimensions of the film it came on.</p>

<p>It’s a few millimetres across, far too long, and about as deep as a piece of paper.</p>

<p>That does wrap it up nice and neatly but for anyone who wants a slightly extended review, here goes: there are about 6 plot strands that are vaguely interwoven (i.e. the characters know each other vaguely). The characters in each are poorly acted (with the exception of <strong>Alan Rickman</strong> – but, you know, he’s Alan Rickman after all), and underdeveloped. You can’t really care that they’re all caught up in love because it’s never built-up or developed on. Everyone is just in love, and you have to both accept and care about it. Nothing is dealt with any further than that. Really.</p>

<p>Don’t see it. Unless you get dragged by a partner, you have no excuses.</p>

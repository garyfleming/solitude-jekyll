    <p>The links are coming fairly fast these days, so I’m just going to dump them as soon as I have enough (rather than post them at the end of each week):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/holocaust.html">Endor Holocaust</a></strong> – Apparently, the destruction of the second Death Star would’ve wiped out Endor. Some people have far too much time,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/">Caching Web Pages</a></strong> – I’ve been meaning to implement this stuff for literally years, but my current (internal) caching system isn’t good enough. It’s on my to-do list though,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38">Accesskeys and reserved keystrokes</a></strong> – Thinking about making your site more accessible by adding accesskey attributes? The combinations to avoid are fairly comprehensive,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://polytopetetris.sourceforge.net/">Polytope Tetris</a></strong> – Ever wondered what 3D Tetris would be like? This program is your chance to experience it; along with 4D, 5D, etc. Imaginary dimensions are fun,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~westside/quantum-intro.html">An Introduction To Quantum Computing</a></strong> – In Quantum Mechanics, you’ve already had a good read of this,</li>

  <li><strong><a href="http://pied.nu/banned/the_Dilbert_Hole/">Dilbert Hole</a></strong> – The rather sick reworked Dilbert comics. Very funny (via <a href="http://www.mrry.co.uk">Derek</a>).</li>

    <p>Given that their is a dearth of pictures of me on my site (with good reason), it’s with some trepidation that I link to a <a href="http://iratescotsman.com/images/phonepics/fri-28-11-2003/gary_gmm.jpg">photo of me asleep in a lecture</a>. I feel that it shows off my best features. The photo comes from <a href="http://iratescotsman.com">Matt</a>, who sneakily took it while I was in that particular pose.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/11/28/TheMedallion/">The Medallion</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I didn’t go to see <strong>The Medallion</strong> with particularly high hopes. I expected some typical <strong>Jackie Chan</strong> action, with some buddy comedy moments provided by <strong>Lee Evans</strong>. Mindless, enjoyable entertainment.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>It’s an absolutely dreadful film, to the extent that it’s quite amusing. It’s rare that a film manages to be so poorly done, so horribly cheesey, that it gets back to the funny stage.</p>

<p>Plot “twists” and occurences frequently appear from nowhere: the little boy suddenly gains the ability to travel between dimensions at the end of the film (which would have been handy when kidnapped by the evil doers), a plane suddenly appearing at Lee Evans’ house, Lee Evans’ wife having a huge weapons cache (we presume that she is some sort of secret agent, but it is never stated or hinted at), the fact that Jackie seems to be both invincible and immortal despite only having half of the medallion (despite being told something to the contrary in the film). There’s a lot more.</p>

<p>Poor acting, poor plot, no characterisation. All in all a humourously bad film.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/11/27/FixedUgcRssFeeds/">Fixed Ugc Rss Feeds</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After the UGC recently changed their pages to a more irregular format (in terms of code), the <a href="/Code/UgcRss/">screen-scraped <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds</a> I made from them fell apart.</p>

<p>I finally got a chance to have a look at the code tonight and was terrified that it might be part of the main scraping that was going wrong (it’s fragile, very fragile), rather than the postprocessing.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the problem was that rather than leave directors and actor details blank (as previously) they now remove the line entirely. This actually reduces the amount of code I was using to parse out the details I didn’t want.</p>

<p>In short, there was a problem and I’ve now fixed it. Please resume enjoyment of the UGC RSS feeds as long as they last before breaking again (such is the perilous nature of screen scraping).</p>

Better idea: let’s remove them from “conversational” English instead,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://perl.plover.com/Regex/article.html">How Regexes Work</a></strong> – Fascinating look at how regular expressions work, not how to use them, but how the language converts them into machines and does state manipulation,</li>

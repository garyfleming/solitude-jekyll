  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/12/03/film-fight-2015-august/">Film Fight 2015: August</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>August is a surprisingly big month, with 8 films in the Film Fight, making it also more than a little late.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Legend of Barney Thomson</strong> is the directorial debut of Robert Carlyle, with himself in the titular role as an unlikeable barber who accidentally becomes a murderer. While the police investigation thread doesn’t quite land, Barney and his mother (a scene-stealing, excellent turn by Emma Thompson) are engaged in a dark comedy that never strays too far into farce, but remains larger than life. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/630358998982762497">my Legend of Barney Thomson Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</strong> is exactly what you expect from the franchise, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. We have some of the biggest practical stunts in cinema, stylish fights, and excellent choreography/editing; the Opera scene stands out as particularly well done. We also have a convoluted, slightly nonsensical plot, but that’s par for the course. Sit back and let the action wash over you. It’s worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/630359040917401600">my Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Pixar are still the best animation studio out there. <strong>Inside-Out</strong> is another good example of their output, but is a little lacking. The imaginative worlds they build have always been fully-formed, and make sense from an internal point of view, but the world inside Inside-Out seems to lack cohesion. The film itself is funny and at times emotional, which is probably no surprise for a film about the embodiments of a child’s emotions. It’s not a bad film but does feel flimsy in places, even for a kids film. Okay.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/630359077584023552">my Inside-Out Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Marshland</strong> is a story about two Spanish detectives with very different approaches investigating some rural murders. The plot itself is able, if a little generic. There’s nothing particularly fresh in the story or characters, you’ve seen variations on this before. It is, however, a very solid effort in the crime fiction genre. Where it excels, however, is in the visuals. The aerial shots are gorgeous, and the colours, framing and lighting are world-class throughout. Good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/630808824530792448">my Marshland Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Trainwreck</strong> is that rarest of things in American cinematic comedies: a fresh take. While elements of it are standard set-pieces, it builds smart jokes on top of enjoyably gross humour. For once, the character building is actually pretty good, with the leads getting more than the standard fall-from-grace and climb-back arc. Amy Schumer shows her comedy translates from stage to TV and now to cinema. Very funny. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/634702288200835073">my Trainwreck Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Absolutely Anything</strong> is that saddest of things: a comedy with absolutely nothing new to say, not even the jokes. The premise is stock (Simon Pegg unexpectedly gets the power to do whatever he wants), and is propped up by tired cliches and reheated stereotypes. Nothing here develops beyond the terrible, narrow starting point. A comedy with no redeeming qualities. Avoid.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/636232217010814976">my Absolutely Anything Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Yet another comedy: <strong>Vacation</strong> digs up the classic National Lampoon series for a modern take. While it fails to better those films (which are admittedly of their time), it manages enough funny, if disjointed, moments to make the whole experience pleasant. Both Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are likeable as the new leads, and the supporting cast each deliver the little that is asked of them. Not a classic, but okay. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/636232616673439744">my Vacation Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Straight Outta Compton</strong> is the dramatisation of the rise and fall of NWA, and its stars. At two and a half hours, the slow start feels like it might be a slog, but things pick up by the halfway mark as the group splinters and the real drama begins. The performances as a whole are decent, and the subject matter is interesting enough. It’s probably a little longer and less focussed than it could have been, but overall it works. Good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/638243014280912896">my Straight Outta Compton Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for August is <strong>Trainwreck</strong>. While none of the (many) films this month was faultless, I think I’d probably see this one again soonest. Note: Barney Thompson had originally been the winner in my first draft, but I changed my mind between writing this and publishing it.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/08/10/film-fight-2015-july/">Film Fight 2015: July</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>July is traditionally big studio film territory, and that is what we have this year. Four films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Terminator Genisys</strong> is yet another entry in a franchise that should be facing its own Judgement Day. The film immediately sets to ripping apart the timeline to great effect, but quickly squanders its boldness with a plot about an evil Facebook-like company. There are some great set pieces, but they’re undermined by the clunky exposition and bad acting (Jai Courtney is especially flat). It’s a better film than its immediate predecessor, but that wouldn’t be hard. Fun, but not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/620256769365942272">my Terminator Genisys Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Seth MacFarlane certainly has his style of comedy and, as in <strong>Ted 2</strong>, it’s starting to wear a little threadbare. Even if you like his heavily referential/gross-out jokes, here they’re presented as a loosely connected series of sketches barely held together by the thinnest of plots. There are a few funny moments, but it’s largely devoid of anything to hold your interest. Avoid this movie, there are many better options. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/622703521671065600">my Ted 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>When <strong>Ant-Man</strong> was first announced, it wasn’t clear how they’d fit a character who is more grounded in the golden age of comics, despite his relative latter day importance. This film manages it with a few knowing winks and a fairly unique heist. When it’s being light and breezy, Ant-Man does very well. The small scale set pieces work surprisingly well, with both action and comedy moments aplenty. It doesn’t, however, earn a few of the main character beats. The relationship between Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne feels particularly unearned. Light-hearted and fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/622704009162436608">my Ant-Man Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Southpaw</strong> is built on every boxing cliche that you can imagine, from the rise-fall-rise structure, to the external struggles (family, drugs), and the training montages. We’re not getting originality so what are we getting? Well, another jawdropping performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, who couldn’t look more different than he did in Nightcrawler, and an absolutely gut-wrenching plot involving his daughter. Some of the emotional moments are genuinely affecting, even if some of the relationships are by the book. It’s a mixed bag, but a solid film. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/625404418943516672">my Southpaw Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>It’s difficult to pick a winner this month, with a serious film and a fun film that could win other months, but I think <strong>Ant-Man</strong> edges out for the simple fact I’d watch it again sooner than later.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/08/06/film-fight-2015-june/">Film Fight 2015: June</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>June’s Film Fight is back up to the nearly standard four films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Spy</strong> is, as the name suggests, a spy film. Melissa McCarthy gets to show off her comedy skills as an agent who is thrust into the field after years behind a desk, and does so admirably. The comedy works as a mixture of great lines, unexpected brutality, some slapstick, but never becoming a spoof. The extended cast are mostly good, but this is definitely McCarthy’s film. We feel sorry for her, but in a way that keeps us on-side. Very funny.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/613009091636690945">my Spy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Jurassic World</strong> is an attempt to bring back the classic dinosaur franchise and, for the most part, uses that as a reason to coast on what we’ve seen before. Chris Pratt is as likeable as he usually is, but almost nothing else in this film works. The plot doesn’t hold together, seeming like an excuse to glue together a bunch of set-pieces. Most of those action sequences are done with CG that is bad enough to undermine them entirely, with the jungle bike ride being particularly awful. This is empty spectacle. A fairly mediocre waste.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/613009590129704960">my Jurassic World Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Michael Fassbender stars as a classic near-silent outlaw with a good heart in the <strong>Slow West</strong>. Following a young man’s journey across the American frontier to find his love, the story is enjoyable if obvious. Instead it’s the beautiful and simple cinematography, coupled with the lead performances, that make this something special. It gets enough right that its few faults become glaring (an unnecessary dream sequence and epilogue, an out of place song), but not overbearingly so. Well-acted, beautifully shot, and generally very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/615850015714615296">my Slow West Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Overnight</strong> does a kind of comedy that you rarely see: building up an uncomfortable tension for over an hour before releasing it in a big moment. There are laughs along the way, but the focus is very much on the weirdness of the situation: a couple meeting new friends at their kid’s playdate, that gets a little out of hand. The whole (tiny) cast is great, and it’s extremely well-paced, save for an unnecessary epilogue. Very worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/616309976626262017">my The Overnight Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>There are three good films this month, but I think I’d probably revisit <strong>Slow West</strong> over the years to take in those performances and scenery.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/08/03/film-fight-2015-may/">Film Fight 2015: May</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For May, Film Fight has 4 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Child 44</strong> is a slow-paced thriller, starring Tom Hardy as a Russian officer trying to link together the disappearances of several children. It takes its time to cover the ground it needs to, building up slowly over the 2 hour or so runtime, without becoming a slog. While some of the accents are weak and the action sequences are ill-advised (but infrequent), it manages to do what it needs to do fairly well. Solid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/596666077892993024">my Child 44 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Samuel L. Jackson seems like he’s open to do pretty much any film that seems like it’ll be fun, and <strong>Big Game</strong> is no exception. It’s clearly on a tiny budget given its action aspirations, but does surprisingly well within its constraints. Following the dual plots of a boy sent into the Finnish wilderness to become a man and the attempted assassination of the US president, that quickly come together, it starts silly and remains generally fun. It’s definitely not a classic, but is an entertaining enough way to pass an afternoon. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/599261912505909248">my Big Game Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>We’ve waited a long time for another in the series, so it’s good to see that <strong>Mad Max: Fury Road</strong> does not disappoint. This is a film that manages to get a surprising amount of world-building and characterisation through the deluge of action; with Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa a clear stand-out. The main event, however, is the relentlessly paced and breath-taking action. Tere are several lengthy sequences of chases that are always crystal clear, and constantly moving. While the handful of quiet scenes are a welcome relief, they are weaker than the rest of the film. An excellent action movie that is as technically brilliant as it is fun to watch. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/600054142862827521">my Mad Max: Fury Road Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Tomorrowland</strong> is probably the most well-meaning film you’ll see for a long time; focussing on a central message of trying your best to improve the world. It’s genuinely nice to see such a hopeful message given in a fun way. Sadly, the film doesn’t quite get to where it is trying to reach. It’s inoffensive, but fairly bland. None of the action sequences really grab you, the plot is a little flimsy, and it does get more than a little heavy-handed when delivering its core message. All in, it’s pleasant but forgettable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/605088264626798592">my Tomorrowland Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for May is <strong>Mad Max: Fury Road</strong>. Great action is rarely done with this level of clarity.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2015/08/02/film-fight-2015-april/">Film Fight 2015: April</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>April is a little quieter, with just three films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck</strong> is a documentary that covers the early years of Cobain’s life, through his success with Nirvana, his relationship with Courtney Love, and ultimately his death. It starts off strongly, by showing a side of the icon that we rarely see, his formative years, in such a way that we both get insight into and sympathy for his later struggles. There are powerful moments throughout the piece, but the presentation is somewhat lacking. Lengthy montages over Nirvana songs make up the bulk of the piece, and these are the weakest segments by a long way. It works far better when it’s being a more traditional talking-heads documentary. Languid pacing ultimately ruin an otherwise interesting take on the man. Mediocre, meandering, maybe dull. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/589374007255965696">my Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Keanu Reeves has a reputation for being a little wooden as an actor, and <strong>John Wick</strong> does very little to shake that, even amongst a movie full of forgettable performances. The story is pretty weak, and the world building is a mess, but it does have some fairly spectacular action sequences. The action choreography works extremely well, stylised and efficient gun play throughout. It’s fun but absolutely mindless. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/589374556000878592">my John Wick Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Avengers: Age Of Ultron</strong> gives us exactly what we now expect from these films: a large ensemble (including some newcomers), fight against a huge threat (in this case, the titular Ultron, played well by James Spader), in a series of increasingly large scale battles. It’s a high quality blockbuster action film with everything that implies. It’s polished, fun, exciting, but very much of its genre. If you like the rest of the Marvel canon then you’ll know whether you want to see this; it’s not the best in the franchise, but it’s certainly not the worst. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/591688035554750464">my Avengers: Age of Ultron Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for April is <strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong>. It wouldn’t win in a stronger month, but I’d watch it again long before seeing the other two films.</p>

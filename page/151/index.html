  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/05/SixDegreesDownhill/">Six Degrees Downhill</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>It was bound to happen at some point. <a href="http://www.crummy.com/devel/downhill/">Downhill</a> is a way to automate six degrees of separation between blogs. And it works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>For anyone who has never heard of six degrees of separation, it’s where you try and find links between 2 things (people, actors, websites) via links between other similar objects. It’s hypothesised that, by following links from one object to another, you can get from any object to any other object in 6 steps or less. The idea works very well.</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider the case of people: finding a connection between person A and person B, who have never met. Person A, in their lifetime, has probably met thousands of people (take time to think about how many people you’ve spoken to in your life – it’s probably huge) who have, in turn, met thousands of others who have met thousands of others etc. By following the links from person to person, we find that we can get to person B in 6 steps or less, no matter who person B is.</p>

<p>If you add more people to your universe of possible people, you do <strong>not</strong> increase the number of links taken to go between people. In fact, you likely decrease the number of links (since more people means more connections).</p>

<p>Back to the original point, Downhill does an admirable job of find the shortest path between two sites, given its dataset. Plus it has the bonus of providing an <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> to the <a href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/ecosystem/">blogging ecosystem</a>. I think that might come in very handy later on.</p>

    <p>Via <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">Stuart</a>, comes the online version of <a href="http://www.20q.net/index.html">Twenty Questions</a>. Think of an animal, vegetable, mineral (yeah, anyone ever picks that) or object and it asks you questions to hopefully guess it.</p>

<p>It works quite convincingly most of the time, just stay away from “cafe” as an object. Although, it learns in time, so even that might not be a problem soon.</p>

    <p>Updates should be back to normal now. Well, at least until next week. I’ve just finished this weeks batch of exams (for more information on those, I suggest reading the round-ups on <a href="http://www.mrry.co.uk">Derek’s site</a>, although I thought Algorithmic Foundations was much harder than he apparently did), and don’t have any more until next week – which is the last block.</p>

<p>So, for at least a week, normality will return. That is all.</p>

    <p>Due to changes in the layout, a few bugs have made their way onto the site. They should die as soon as the site cache is emptied (which will be when I add this piece of content). If you see any residual bugs, try reloading by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>F5</kbd> together.</p>

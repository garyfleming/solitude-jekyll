  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/07/09/PieBeerAndTextile/">Pie, Beer And Textile?</a></h1>

  <div class="post">
    <p>First up: How do we feel about <a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.ls-la.net/">99 bottles of beer in 571 languages</a>? Programming languages. Yes, someone has created a list of very similar programs in pretty much every language that’s ever done anything useful (and about 550 others). Too much spare time, but interesting to compare syntax nonetheless.</p>

<p>We now have Necho support in the <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/">feed validator</a> (formerly the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> validator). It is based on the 1st of July snapshot and, although there have been changes since then, it works nicely.</p>

<p>Most exciting for me is the <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/739/">announcement of Textile 2</a>. Textile is an integral part of my developing <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> these days (I even have written permission from <a href="http://www.textism.com/">Dean Allen</a> to include it in any final public release I might make).</p>

<p>There were a few things I had to change about the first version: it got a bit scatty for me when dealing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">del</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ins</code> tag, and refused to do the right thing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> tags without a fair amount of mucking around. I also really wanted a detextile function for editing and began work on it before giving up. At a glance in the code of Textile 2, there seems to be an experimental version in there. Nice! I look forward to being able to mess around more with it.</p>

    <p>In lieu of actual content, I thought I’d do one of those entirely links based posts that people are so fond of. Note: there are actually a few pieces of real content waiting to be added, but I thought since I got a decent set of links today, I’d post them instead.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/archives/echo_rss_and_pixies.php">Pixie Theory: <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> vs. Necho</a>: By thinking of the opposing sides as either pixies or not pixies, we can figure out what side of an argument we should be on. Necho wins, of course.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001328.htm">BurningBird: I remember usenet</a>: <acronym title="America Online">AOL</acronym> is coming for weblogs. As any right thinking individual knows, this is the first sign of the apocalypse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogshares.com">Blogshares</a>: I finally became a blogshares millionairre today. To celebrate, I devalued the stock for this site by selling a shitload of it; earning myself yet more money. Capitalism is, indeed, fun.</p>

    <p>Good news! <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EchoExample">Necho</a> support has been hacked into the current version of <a href="http://www.methodize.org/nntprss">nntprss</a>. I’ve just added the hack to my version and it works perfectly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/EarlyHackingInNecho">The nntprss necho hack</a> comes from <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/">Semantic Web</a>. Good job, that man!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.themarsvolta"><strong>The Mars Volta</strong></a> brought us the experimental <strong>Tremulant EP</strong> as a statement of intentions for their debut album. They spoke big words through layers of noise orchestrated to perfection: and the album lives up the to promise.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://www.theprp.com/reviews/themarsvolta.shtml"><strong>“Deloused In the Comatorium”</strong></a> borrows much from the bands partial instantiation as the defining moment in rock known as <strong>At The Drive-In</strong>, they’ve taken their previous band’s work and gone off in a tangent as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The result is eclectic, but compelling. You’ll never notice that the majority of the songs break the 6 minute mark (most still going at full pace), it’s that immersing.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p><cite>Tim Bray</cite> makes some interesting points about <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/04/Nations">the abstraction of Nations</a>. I can generally agree with him on most of it.</p>

<p>But there’s one thing that I think is important: just because our families and friends are more important to us than our countries, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t contribute to our country as a whole. We should help to make it as good a place as we can, since it is within our reach.</p>

<p>From there, our country (government and national organisations) should help other countries. The notion of “doing good” could potentially be distributed well across this abstraction.</p>

<p>Of course, that’s never the way it works. Maybe it’s late and I’m tired, maybe I’m just dreaming, but maybe we could use these arbitary systems to help others in other arbitary systems.</p>

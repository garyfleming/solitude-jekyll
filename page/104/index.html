    <p>It’s been a struggle for the last few months, third year has seen many casualties, but it’s finally over. My last exam was yesterday and, for the first time since October, I can stop thinking about university. It is a <em>very</em> good feeling.</p>

<p>A few days of celebrations planned before updates here return to normal. Well, they will for about a week before the bigger news (and subsequent downtime around here).</p>

<p><ins><strong>Update</strong>: Ok, so apparently the year is actually 2004, and not 2005 as the title suggests. But I won’t have exams next year, so… quiet.</ins></p>

<p><ins><strong>Update 2</strong>:</ins> For anyone who is interested, <a href="http://www.chris-miller.org/">Chris</a> is hosting <a href="http://www.chris-miller.org/gallery/album16" title="Pictures from the 2004 3rd year Glasgow DCS students night out">pictures from the final day celebrations</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/06/01/filmdreams/">Film Dreams</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’m not normally one to post about stuff that has happened to me personally or to keep some kind of dream record but the sheer number and vividness of my dreams lately makes me want to quickly write about them. Interestingly, they all have one thing in common: they have films entwined in the plot.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you will, the basic plot of Flash Gordon (hero fights evil emperor, saves the girl, wins the day). Got it? Now set it in Glasgow, cast <a href="http://iratescotsman.com/">Matt</a> as Ming, myself as Flash, and have a getaway chase scene on go-karts through a palace that has appeared on Buchannan street. That is the kind of dream I’ve been having.</p>

<p>Another? A more literal re-telling: Having just come out of seeing Eddie Izzard perform, some friends and I get lost on the subway (which is no longer underground), ultimately ending up back at the same theatre. Rather than see the genius of Izzard again, we go into the bar. I start talking to Shaft (who is being played by Samuel L. Jackson in this dream) who is telling how tired he is, having not slept in several days. A call comes in over the radio: a local gang boss has been found. Shaft, who clearly isn’t going to take any crap from anyone, decides to round up a posse.</p>

<p>My friends and I decide that he probably needs some help and walk along the street. By the time we get along the road, he has amassed an army of angry young men with pieces. They began crossing town to go and get the gang boss. I take a motorcycle across town to arrive first, where we find a TV crew covering the whole thing.</p>

<p>The rest is slightly garbled: a chase through the villians mansion, down a secret passage and out into a street straight from the 1920’s. Two security guards grab him, and I go to put the cuffs on. At that he punches one in the throat and… my alarm goes off, ending the whole thing. Dammit.</p>

<p>Oh well, here’s hoping tonights doesn’t disappoint.</p>

    <p>Yes, it’s been quiet here for the last few days. A full random link post will follow shortly (and it will be rather large), but for now I’d like to draw attention to <a href="">an interview with the <acronym title="Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy">HHGG</acronym> movie writer</a>.</p>

<p>Although, like many fans of the excellent Douglas Adams books, I was apprehensive about the film possibilities, this interview quashes all fears. The film looks like it is in safe hands.</p>

    <p>While checking for information on bus timetables yesterday, <a href="http://www.arrivabus.co.uk/">Arriva</a> (the main operator in my area) astounded me with some piss poor design.</p>

<p>The left hand-side of their page features a form that allows you to input a town and route number to find information on it. Great. Except that upon submitting the form it doesn’t just send your information to a page in which results will be returned, or redirect you to the appropriate information. Oh no, that would be far too simple.</p>

<p>Instead, it executes a javascript function using the long since deprecated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript:</code> protocol (you do have JS turned on for something as simple as this, right?), pops-up a small window which does nothing but cause a redirect in your original window and then closes, and then takes you to a results page. Javascript and pop-ups for a <em>redirect</em>? What? Don’t get me started on the crufty <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s either.</p>

    <p>My final year project is now complete (expect more on that at some stage), celebrating has been done thrice (just another two more to go), pictures were taken (of the <a href="http://derek.stuwee.org/gallery/CompSocEaster">CompSoc Easter</a> celebrations at Cafe West), sleep has been caught up on, work has begun on the first project of the holidays, and it feels like a huge burden has been lifted. I’m not the kind of person to get stressed or panic, but it feels very good to no longer have such a constant and heavy workload.</p>

<p>Enough of this self indulgent tripe. Real posts begin again this week.</p>

    <p>A quick message to say that Solitude will largely disappear for the next two weeks or so. Coincidentally, that’s how long I’ve got to finish my final year project (something about efficient plagiarism detection) which I’m sure will get a post or so here in the future.</p>

<p>The odd post may appear and <a href="http://del.icio.us/solitude" title="Links from Solitude">random links</a> certainly will continue.</p>

<p>Some new toys will appear when I return, as well as documentation and source for the recently updated <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/ActoRss/">Acto<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym></a>, which provides RSS feeds for most actors, producers and directors (it is now more accurate in selecting the correct actor).</p>

<p>Back in a few.</p>

    <p>Five films in this months film fight, a little bit more interesting than <a href="/Archives/2005/01/31/FilmFightJanuary2005" title="Film fight for January 2005">last month</a>.</p>

<p>Steven Soderbergh impressed a lot of people when he remade rat pack classic, <strong>Ocean’s Eleven</strong>. For some people’s tastes the script was over-polished, a hundred writers making every line zing until the words practically lit up Clooney and Pitt’s teeth. It did, however, feature an entertaining (if somewhat silly) heist. In true Hollywood fashion, a sequel was inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>Ocean’s Twelve</strong>. It lacks the polish of it’s predecessor (a good film), but is also missing a plot, reasonable nudges by the director, and crucially a heist. You see, although the team desperately need to get millions of dollars, you never actually see them commit a robbery. A few glimpses are shown retrospectively but it’s not enough to satisfy. That the key heist was pulled off in such an incongruous fashion to what one would hope for (it’s not a real spoiler to say it was a simple bag switch) is disappointing. If you can’t be satisfied with looking at the mugs of Hollywood A-listers as they show off what is essentially their summer vacation mess around, don’t bother.</p>

<p>Another remake next, <strong>Assault On Precinct 13</strong>. Almost entirely predictable, following the standard spot the stiff rules to the letter, only verging off where a modern film must. The cast put in reasonable performances and the isolated in the city motif works well to create an urban tension. Not bad, just not original; perhaps what should be expected from a safe remake.</p>

<p>We’re now several days after <strong>Million Dollar Baby</strong> took home the lion’s share of this year’s Oscars. It deserved every one of them. Although the character played by Clint Eastwood is an awkward stereotype to begin with, his good natured mean streak wins out in the end. The story itself is gripping, punching you through every blow that Hilary Swank’s character (perfectly realised, I might add) had to go through to get respect, and the struggle beyond that. Fantastic film.</p>

<p>A documentary to get a little change. The premise of <strong>The Yes Men</strong> is solid: activists set up a satirical website for the WTO and were then mistaken as representatives. They then proceed to give atrocious talks which represent WTO policy as it really is, as opposed to how it is stated by the organisation. The pranks are amusing, and the response is gob smacking, but the film is let down in several ways.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Yes Men themselves come across as prima-donnas. They seem to be in it for the attention more than the issues at hand. In fact, there is one scene fairly far into the film when they are speaking to another activist and he educates them on WTO policy; the very same thing they’ve been apparently blindly protesting. The editing is also lacklustre. While their lateness for one conference (forgetting about time zones) is an amusing aside, the film is filled with, well, filler. This might have made an amusing 45 minute TV show, but there is clearly not enough material to warrant an 80 minute cinema release.</p>

<p>Finally, live action anime from Japan, <strong>Casshern</strong>. Now, you might be asking how a live action animated film would work. The answer: human actors in appropriately ridiculous costumes, in front of huge <acronym title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</acronym> sets. Strangely the aesthetic almost works. Almost. It’s let down by an emptiness and some poor colouring choices. Sure, the world is supposed to be a dystopian future, but a few more people (drones) in the huge streets would make it fit in with perceptions better.</p>

<p>Sadly, the film itself is dreadful. Truly awful. I like anime, but this is of the low quality, silly, ill-planned variety. Stupid characters, overly long monologues about vague rubbish, an overarching philosophy that has only a few scraps of meat to it; bad. The timing is off (way too long), the directing is shameful, the characterisation is woeful. After seeing it, you’ll be dumbfounded by how it could go so wrong after an almost promising first half hour. Bad.</p>

<p>So, without a doubt, this months winner is Million Dollar Baby. The Academy finally got something right.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.biffyclyro.com">Biffy Clyro</a> were the band to be watching this month. Not content with launching a single for the awesome “One One Word Comes To Mind” from their third album, Infinity Land, they played a UK tour (which has now moved into a small European leg) and did several radio sessions and signings along the way. Their Zane Lowe session featured one of the finest covers of their carrer, a very Biffy reworking of Franz Ferdinand’s biggest hit, “Take Me Out”. ‘Mon the Biffy.</p>

<p>Biffy were supported by <a href="http://www.hell-is-for-heroes.net">Hell Is For Heroes</a>. They also released a new single this month to promote their forthcoming album, “Transmit/Disrupt”. The single, “Models For The Programme”, included a very nice piece of limited edition pink vinyl.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themarsvolta.com">The Mars Volta</a> finally followed up mind-blowing debut album, “De-Loused in The Comatorium”, with an album whose track titles are equally bizarre. “Frances The Mute” is a 5-track masterpiece (split into 13 tracks on the <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym> listing for legal reasons), each containing distinct (and named) movements. The first four tracks sound essentially like an astonishing intro for 30-minute finale, Cassandra Geminni (yes that is the correct spelling.) Even this early on, a contender for album of the year.</p>

<p>Preparing to get back into full touring mode for their new album, <a href="http://www.idlewild.co.uk">Idlewild</a> played a short acoustic set in Glasgow. Playing on the release date of the first single, “Love Steals Us From Loneliness”, the set mixed up old favourites with some new numbers. While the band have certainly moved away from their punk indie roots, the new sound is pleasant enough.</p>

<p>RockRage put up a number of <a href="http://www.rockrage.com/media/fonts/musicfonts.html">band fonts</a>, which should be a good resource for fan sites and those interested in typography (there are some very nice fonts in there).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reel-big-fish.com/">Reel Big Fish</a> announced that their new album will be called “We’re Not Happy Til You’re Not Happy”, which will include an update of one of their finer songs, “Beer”. Let’s hope they don’t ruin it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.qotsa.com">Queens Of The Stone Age</a> unveil their first single since the band suffered major line-up changes (basically, Nick and Mark left or were kicked out, depending on who you ask). “Little Sister” seems slightly toned down from previous work in terms of driving guitar riffs, but with drumming that suits the mellower sound.</p>

    <p>Have you ever been really great at something, anything? I don’t mean ok, or better than average, I mean really good. It’s a great feeling. Every bit of practice, all the blood and sweat that went into getting that good, is worth it in the end. You feel vindicated by having a new skill.</p>

<p>Have you then, for whatever reason, stopped doing this thing you were great at (notice the past tense there, it’s lucidly foreboding)? You just haven’t done it in a few years. Maybe you were bored with it, had other commitments, or a vital piece of equipment was no longer available. These things happen, and moving on is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>So, after your “away” spell, you come back to your skill because the situation is now like it was when you started it; your stars in alignment, your interest peaked, whatever. And then the inevitable part: you can’t do it anymore. The years of practice forgotton, the sweat gone, and the clumsiness aparrent for all to see.</p>

<p>It’s depressing, and embarassing. You <em>know</em> you could do it, you have evidence to prove it, but you can’t do it now. In time, you could get it back. But after the initial shock, do you really want to go back through the rigour of training again? That’s up to you, and I can offer no advice either way.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the last entry being rushed (I was leaving minutes after I wrote it), the zombie simulator link was pointing to the wrong place. It’s been fixed now.</p>

<p>It would make sense to add some sanity checks to links in entries: prompt the user if they link to the same place twice in one entry. Not a big idea, but one that would stop things like this happening again.</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/">zombie simulator</a> is a lot of fun. Go play now!</p>

    <p>It’s Thursday. It’s 2pm, and it’s time for more random links:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://feedster.com/blog/archives/51_Time_to_think_about_SpamBack.html">Fight The Spammers</a></strong> – Over at the Feedster blog, there is a dicussion about fighting Spammers at the bandwidth level. Not a bad idea, but costly at the allied end.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://freebsd.mu/freebsd/archives/000039.html">Neural Nets in <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym></a></strong> – Someone has created a neural net class in PHP. Astounding stuff, I can’t wait to see what people do with this.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.html">Gender Determination</a></strong> – An algorithm that determines whether someone is male or female by a sample of their writing. It worked on every test I tried, bar one. Of course, that one person was myself. Yes, I write like a girl.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/">Zombie Simulator</a></strong> – <ins><em>FIXED LINK</em></ins>. Easily the coolest link of the day. A java applet that simulates zombies overrunning a city. Lots of emergent behaviour is apparent, and lots of switches to play with. I <em>will</em> be playing with the code for this very soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some big news coming soon… But probably not for another day or two.</p>

    <p>As much as I expected it to be a big budget wash out, <strong>Pirates Of The Caribbean</strong> is actually reasonably entertaining. <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> leads with his usual balance of excellent timing and quirky delivery, <strong>Keira Knightley</strong> plays her part adequately, and <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>… He showed up.</p>

<p>Yes, the plot is predictable, some of the lines are horribly overwritten, but there are enough mildly amusing bits to make it a worthwhile watch. Certainly a <strong>lot</strong> better than that <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/08/19/Chicago" title="Chicago, tedious film of the year">hideous dog shit</a> I watched later the same day.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/08/19/Chicago/">Chicago</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Watching <strong>Chicago</strong> is a lot like falling off a large cliff towards a spike: initially terrifying, your entire life flashing before your eyes, a voice shouting <em>“WHY ME?”</em>, and, just as Richard Gere begins singing, the spike can’t hit you fast enough.</p>

<p>Of course, as soon as you want sweet jagged relief, Father Time pulls a fast one and everything goes excruciatingly slowly. Every note hangs in the air for hours, every word spoken in a forced accent cuts, every torturous second eating away at your will to live.</p>

<p>The end never comes too soon.</p>

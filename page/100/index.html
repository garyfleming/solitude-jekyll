    <p>In a move that will shock all right-minded cinema goers, Tom Cruise is bearable in the movie <strong>Collateral</strong>. More than that: he’s actually pretty damn good. Playing the confident straight forward killer seems to be a role that he was made to play, pulling it off with a degree of style that gets you on his side.</p>

<p>The film itself is the tale of a fairly ordinary cab driver who, upon accepting an all night fare from Cruise, begins becoming more and more unstable as events unfold.</p>

<p>Tightly shot, well paced and Hollywood dialogue at a minimum, Collateral is a very pleasant piece of cinema. Kudos.</p>

    <p>If you haven’t realised by now, <strong>Will Ferrell</strong> is a God. Outstanding timing and the kind of naive dumb act that makes the sides tremble as if the largest feather in the world had just been purchased and was heading for your feet. From this modest start, throw in some seventies cheese, unexpected violence, a tight script and quirky supporting cast, and you have the beginnings of a legendary film.</p>

<p><strong>Anchorman</strong> is that film.</p>

<p>I’ll say no more because I wouldn’t want to ruin a single character or line from it. Hilarious from the start to the end of the credits (don’t leave until the very end).</p>

    <p>I’m an Asian film fan (in that I like a lot of films made in Asia, rather than being Asian and liking films, but I digress). I like that films get made there that don’t cause grey matter to commit beautiful ritual suicide, and that I can imagine such a thing having seen it in such a movie. <strong>Infernal Affairs</strong> showed us that action could be stylish, violent and have a plot, while <strong>Audition</strong> showed us that cheese wire is pretty nasty stuff. Silly ideas can become excellent films.</p>

<p>It is with dismay, then, that I say <strong>Phone</strong> is awful.</p>

<p>Korea is supposed to be where the horror genre is at the moment, having allegedly created the best version of seminal flick, <strong>The Ring</strong>. Sadly, <strong>Phone</strong> shows no signs of intelligence. Instead we’re greeted with terrible acting, bad dialogue (not aided by a translation that should have been spell-checked), and some of the worst pacing I’ve seen. This film could have been cut by an hour and retained what plot it had.</p>

<p>Sometimes silly ideas are just silly.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html">Live Bookmarks</a> are a new feature in the FireFox 1.0 candidate release. It basically lets you view an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed is a folder of bookmarks, updating as the site updates. Very clever idea, decent implementation too.</p>

<p>However, to <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/14/liveBookmarks">claim it is a browser innovation</a> is wrong. Internet Explorer has been doing the exact same thing with <acronym title="Channel Definition Format">CDF</acronym> feeds for an age. As long as the MIME type is being served correctly, clicking on a link to a CDF file adds it as a live folder in bookmarks.</p>

<p>Clever, but now new.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/09/15/IsEchoAtomDead/">Is Echo/Atom Dead?</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I hate to say it (especially after putting in so much effort), but is the project codenamed Atom/Echo dead? Let’s look carefully:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">Echo wiki</a> is largely dead. A quick look at <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RecentChanges">the wiki’s recent changes</a> shows that work has definitely slowed right down.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/NameFinalVote">Name Voting</a> is an absolute mess. All of the originally cleared candidates have been voted out, the best names (Echo/Atom) have been deemed unviable, and the new names are… well, awful. Kitak, Mota, Syntia? Are we naming concept cars?</li>
  <li>Oh yeah, and the number of votes for each entry are very much single figures, which doesn’t look good for community adoption.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/maillist.html">Atom mailiing list</a> has plunged in usage. From around 30 entries a day at it’s peak to, at best, 5. Ouch.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://danja.typepad.com/fecho/">Formerly Echo blog</a> is pretty dead too. Updates are sparse and short.</li>
  <li>Very little mention of it in the places we used to see it mentioned at least twice a post.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this, we can say that work has definitely died down. But, that doesn’t quite paint a fair picture. Important avenues are being explored elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bitworking.org/rfc/draft-gregorio-07.html">Atom<acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym></a> is doing particularly well. Amongst others, a <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/PhpAtomApiImplementation"><acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> implementation of the API</a> is pretty much done, as well as PERL and Java versions. That’s a big step.</p>

<p>It’s tough to say. The forward motion we once saw has hit a wall. Hopefully, the apathy will clear up soon. We’ve all put in too much effort to let it die.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s been one of those fun days, but to save much moaning I’ll cut to the point: my mobile phone has died a horrible death and it’ll be a few days before I’ll be able to fix it or replace it. Fun. I know some people who actually know me read this, so consider this the best notice I can give for a few days.</p>

<p>In my infinite wisdom, I made sure not to keep a list of peoples numbers I had stored separate (on paper etc), so chances are I’ve lost 90% of the numbers I had. Joy.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Big news: I finally have a comments system. It should work, but if you spot any errors or get erroneous warnings, please let me know (via email or comment).</p>

<p>Rules? Stay vaguely on topic, no spam, no flaming, be nice to each other etc. The usual sort of thing. Oh yeah, and you take responsibility for anything you say: IP’s are being logged if banning is absolutely necessary, but I doubt it will.</p>

<p>I don’t expect the comments to get very busy, but knock yourself out. It’s something I wouldn’t mind being surprised about.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Given the recent <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/cgi-bin/mt/mezzo/archives/000261.asp">hassle over creative commons licensing</a>, I’ve decided to pull the creative commons license from this site. It’s just to open to abuse, and misinterpretation.</p>

<p>From this day onwards, Solitude no longer uses a creative commons license. However, I can’t revoke the license for previous entries. So, entries between me adding the license and entries prior to today (that does not include earlier entries today) are still under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">by attribution, non commercial, share alike license</a>.</p>

<p>When I find a fairer and safer license, I’ll use it.</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>With enough twists to make anyone doubt every characters motives, <strong>Cypher</strong> is surprisingly well-written for how subdued it is. It’s the story of Morgan (<strong>Jeremy Northam</strong>), a man who wants to escape the drudgery of his life by going into espionage. Inevitably, he gets into a lot more than he wanted.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the film also shows that <strong>Lucy Liu</strong>, the lead female character, can actually act. Shocking, when put side by side with her work in <strong>Charlie’s Angels</strong>.</p>

<p>It is not the best film in the world, the twists do start to push it after a while, but it’s certainly a great deal better than some of the garbage that is being showing recently.</p>

    <p>It’s only been up for 2 days and someone is already using my <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/PalindromeAPI.php">Palindrome <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym></a>. Hooray!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mrry.co.uk">Derek</a> is using it in quite a similar way to the already existing form, but who cares? It’s really just an academic exercise just now anyway. So, go visit the <a href="http://www.mrry.co.uk/palindromegame.php">Palindrome Game</a>.</p>

<p>In related news, I’m going to introduce a few new methods soon. Just need to get into the mindset to code again.</p>

    <p><strong>Identity</strong> (starring <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Cusack,John">John Cusack</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Liotta,Ray">Ray Liotta</a>) is stylish, tense, genuinely creepy and, ultimately, stupid.</p>

<p>The basic premise is interesting enough: a bunch of strangers get stranded together at a motel until morning, their numbers lessening as the night unfolds. So far, so slasher flick. But the strangers come to realise that they all have a connection to each other and they might not be their by accident after all. At this point, there is a real sense of sinister going-ons.</p>

<p>And then the words “ancient Indian burial ground” are mentioned. Thankfully, however, that most laughable of plot devices is never capitalised on. Instead, we’re subjected to something far more embarrasing; the sort of surprise only a writer who ran out of interest could come up with. The audience left laughing.</p>

<p>A perfect example of a movie ruined by a twist.</p>

    <p>So, it’s happened once more. To turn it into an end of term tradition, some of my friends and I went bowling today. <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/03/21/#BowlingBowlingBowling">The last time I went bowling</a>, my hand was all but crippled. This time it’s my knee. How that happened is anyones guess.</p>

<p>We played 10 games: each winning three before the big finale. The person who did worst last time absolutely stormed it this time, stealing the last game and ridiculing the rest of our scores.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I managed to get the high-score of the day: a modest 150. It’s probably my personal best.</p>

<p>Anyway, bowling might look like a sport for the lazy, but boy does it hurt if you’re not used to it. Ice-pack this way, please.</p>

    <p>A week or so ago, I <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/06/09/#CheckingPalindromes">updated the palindrome code</a> found on this site, but I couldn’t implement everything I wanted to. Now, I have the time to do it. For the past day or two, I’ve been messing around with <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Call">XMLRPC</acronym> servers and clients, trying to get a feel for how it all works. It’s really quite simple once you get into it.</p>

<p>So, in this spirit, I have now got <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/PalindromeAPI.php">an API for the palindrome checker</a>. While it only has one method at the moment, I’m sure if anything else comes to mind, it’ll be trivial to add it in.</p>

<p>More importantly, by having an XMLRPC server running, I’ll be able to add and incorporate support for more web services; such as <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback">pingback</a>. While it’s not available yet, it will be soon enough.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/06/17/DomainsAndCollapse/">Domains And Collapse</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Yesterday, I paid my annual bill for hosting (so the site won’t be disappearing for at least a year). But I also made a sem-major change.</p>

<p>I used to host a site called Frustrated Artist Commune. Other than actually providing hosting and incorporating Finetto for them, I had nothing to do with it. After months of inactivity and absolutely no interest in the site from its owners, I’ve removed it. It ate a fair whack of server space and was, in effect, dead.</p>

<p>The other thing I’ve been thinking about is the main domain at <a href="http://www.vkps.co.uk">vkps.co.uk</a>. For months now, it’s been inactive (other than the <a href="http://www.vkps.co.uk/Publick/EWN/"><acronym title="Extended Winer Number">EWN</acronym> namespace</a>, which takes a fair number of hits to this day). This site was only supposed to be a temporary measure to keep updates going while I worked on the main site. In reality, I focussed any development time on Finetto, which was then incorporated into this site. So really, I’ve just been working on this site.</p>

<p>Over time, Solitude has evolved into pretty much what vkps was supposed to be: a constantly updated resource, with code, film and music reviews and other essays. So what to do with the main domain? I don’t really know. Do you?</p>

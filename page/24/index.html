    <p>A very quiet December, with only two films viewed.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</strong> is that rare sequel that manages to be confidently better than the original in almost every regard. The pacing of the film is excellent, moving through months of propaganda in minutes without feeling rushed before settling into a slower, but still lively, pace for the main events. It’s a little darker, the situation unravels a little more and, most importantly, I actually cared about what happened to most of the characters by the end; something I can’t really say about the original. The ending marks it very much as the middle chapter of the series, but it had done enough by that point that a cliff-hanger ending didn’t seem unfair. Well worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/414704213499715584">my The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</strong>, on the other hand, was never going to live up to the original, which was likely my most watched comedy of the preceeding ten years. Let’s be clear: it’s a good comedy, better than most of the competition, and with some incredibly funny moments (Doby!). In fact, for the first hour it seems like it might just pull off getting into the same league as the original. Sadly, it begins retreading the same plot arc as the original, and the same jokes. While the supporting cast are still great (Brick is a particular highlight), it’s Ron Burgundy that seems a little off. Rather than being the out-of-time, dumb, but loveable anchorman, he is played as an amped-up-to-eleven version of the original; a louder, pantomine parody. Again, it’s a good film, it’s funny, but it’s not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/414704891345375232">my Anchorman 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The final monthly winner for 2013, then, is <strong>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.</strong> An unexpectedly fun sequel.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/12/30/film-fight-2013-november/">Film Fight 2013: November</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For the November Film Fight, we have 4 films.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa</strong> is an attempt to take the over-the-top pranks of Jackass and try to cram them into a story, with mixed success. It plays out in a similar fashion to much of Sascha Baron Cohen’s work, like Borat or Bruno: unsuspecting members of the public play against the characters in ridiculous situations to see how they react. It’s dumb and mean-spirited humour of the lowest form, albeit done very well. This film won’t change your mind about Johnny Knoxville and his brand of humour, but if you already find it funny then this is a pretty good example of the genre. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/397487061801791488">my Bad Grandpa Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Captain Phillips</strong> seems bizarrely tone-deaf. At times, the story of a tanker captain taken hostage by Somali pirates is remarkably tense and, despite knowing the ending, you can’t help but be drawn in by every twist. Hanks puts in his usual, down-to-Earth and absolutely spot-on performance, with no surprises, with the Somali pirates coming across with jagged believability. However, at other times, it goes way too far in one direction or another. The opening with Catherine Keener is so underplayed that no-one appears to be making any effort. Contrast that with the many Oscar-baiting moments later, and you have a film that, while very good on the whole, can’t seem to decide what to do with itself. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/401486572849078272">my Captain Phillips Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The next entry in Marvel’s cinematic universe is <strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong>. The lead character isn’t the most cerebral in Marvel’s canon, and that is fully on display here. Expect the usual “smash, drink and nobility” sentiments wrapped around a plot where Thor saves everyone from world-ending doom. So, nothing new. That’s not to say it’s bad. Thor is fun and dumb, and I’m not sure anything else would work. Loki is as great as ever, playing the meddlesome brother, but the main bad guy, Malekith, is so generic that you wonder why they brought in as great an actor as Christopher Ecclestone to do the part. The film, then, is ultimately fun and fine, but you’ve seen it many times before. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/401818759737790464">my Thor: The Dark World Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Gravity</strong> is Alfonso Cuaron’s way of following up the his 2006 Film Fight finalist, Children of Men. It is an astounding piece of film that, I believe, cannot be done full justice in a home-viewing setting. The 3D IMAX screenings draw you in better than anything else I’ve seen in the format, with the eye-filling frames giving you nowhere to look for respite. The story itself is a little saccharine at times, but that’s largely beside the point. The film is a journey that mixes moments of eerie calm with uncontrolled frantic action. I don’t want to say too much about the content, other than it’s a thrilling movie, with a great lead performance and great support. Definitely see this in as big a format as you can. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/403298583354408961">my Gravity Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for November is <strong>Gravity</strong>, a film that was worth waiting seven years to see.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2013/11/24/film-fight-2013-october/">Film Fight 2013: October</a></h1>

  <div class="post">
    <p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">Five films in the Film Fight for October…</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">First up, <strong>Filth</strong> is a film in the Irvine Welsh tradition: an anti-hero swept into a maddening situation of his own making, presented in a surreal technicolour, before dropping into a cold, dank reality. That Filth isn’t anything new doesn’t mean it’s bad, it’s not. James McAvoy does a fantastic job of showing the breakdown of a cop who was always a little on the edge. Supported by a fun cast, he is certainly the film’s highlight. The film is somewhat undone by the weirdness. While it mostly fits the portrayal, it sometimes lacks a point beyond being strange. Overall, the film is decent, but could’ve been better. A film to watch, rather than rewatch. (See </span><a style="line-height: 1.4;" href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/386857762451243008">my Filth Twitter review</a><span style="line-height: 1.4;">).</span></p>

<p><strong>How I Live Now</strong> is the story of an American girl who comes to stay a summer with her cousins in rural England. Unfortunately, a devastating war breaks out whilst no adults are around. The film could’ve descended into a crude Lord of the Flies rip-off at this point but it doesn’t. Instead it does an excellent job of building a new survivalist world in the background, the young cast slipping into it seamlessly as the world collapses around them. There are many excellent moments of despair (that I won’t spoil) but the film is somewhat let down by a flimsy central romance, hints of psychic abilities that go nowhere (apparently they’re more important in the book), and more than a few lines of clunky dialogue delivered poorly by the youngest actors in the cast. All in, it’s a beautifully presented work, let down by the details. One to see. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/388384958579875840">my How I Live Now Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Wherever you sit on the Wiki Leaks debate, <strong>The Fifth Estate</strong> should’ve been an interesting insight into the organisation’s early days and founders. While Benedict Cumberbatch puts in an excellent performance as a controlling, jealous and paranoid Assange and Daniel Brühl does a good job of playing his level-headed counterpart, they can’t save the film from its many flaws. When it has to lower itself to silly CG office spaces filled with countless copies of Assange to explain the technology of the organisation, you know that it’s not going to get better. A real shame, given the meaty subject. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/391936126996336640">my The Fifth Estate Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The problem with <strong>Prisoners</strong> is that it’s an afternoon murder mystery with torture porn set-dressing: it has the cliched attempts to mislead of the former, and the unnecessary and over-the-top suffering of the latter. I don’t really want either. The cast can’t be held responsible here, as everyone puts in an outstanding performance; from Jackman’s angry father-figure to Dano’s disturbed young man, the principle actors do a great job. It’s a shame, then, that they don’t get better material with which to work. You’ll see many of the attempts to fool you coming, as not one hasn’t been seen many times before. All of that said, when it lets Jackman’s character go off-the-rails, things can get remarkably tense. Just how far will he go to save his daughter? Good, but not a classic. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/394127155665199104">my Prisoners Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re looking for a ridiculous, over-the-top action film with lots of B-movie trimmings, then <strong>Machete Kills</strong> will work for you. It’s not as well made or silly as the original, but you’re unlikely to care. You’ll get the intentionally terrible dialogue, wonky effects, explosions and half-baked characters you’d expect from a grindhouse film. Enjoy after a drink or two for maximum impact. (see <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/394127813269139456">my Machete Kills Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner for October is Prisoners. It’s not a strong winner, but the best of a fun-to-average bunch.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>A fairly quiet month in September, with only two films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Way, Way Back</strong> is a coming-of-age indie film, about a dorky boy who, with the help of Sam Rockwell’s character finds the self-confidence he badly needs. It does the dweeb-stands-up-for-himself trope reasonably well, but balances it with some difficult family moments. The performances are all decent enough, with Steve Carrell standing out as being cast against-type but doing well. As these kind of films go, this one is remarkably good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/376368777106952192">my The Way, Way Back Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Ain’t Them Bodies Saints</strong> has Casey Affleck as an outsider who suffers for someone else’s mistakes. As he goes to prison, he leaves behind a family who have to cope without him. The problem is that nothing in the story makes you care particularly about the suffering of either of the leads, and the film has little else going on. Without any reason to buy into the narrative, the movie feels unnecessarily drawn-out and dull. Entirely forgettable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/382598905537368064">my Ain’t Them Bodies Saints Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>The Way, Way Back</strong> for a good take on a well-trodden genre.</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For August, we have 5 films in the Film Fight…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Monsters University</strong> is the entirely unnecessary prequel to what is possibly Pixar’s greatest film, Monsters Inc. It obviously has a heavy burden to live up to its forebear. The good news is that it doesn’t entirely fluff it, though it clearly isn’t operating at the same level. It has a number of funny bits, interesting characters and the charm you’d expect of a Pixar movie, so you won’t miss out in seeing it. That said, it feels like it’s just being made for the money; building out a backstory that no-one needed. It’s good, not great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/364004946032590849">my Monsters University Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Nicholas Winding Refn has directed some excellent films, like Bronson and Drive (which won the <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2011/12/31/film-fight-2011-finale/">2011 Film Fight Finale</a> – even if I latter changed my mind, and decided that Another Earth should’ve won). <strong>Only God Forgives</strong> is not an excellent film; it’s astonishingly bad. While it looks incredible throughout, the rest is pretentious, lacking substance, flimsy and poorly constructed. It’s unevenly paced, has paper-thin characters, and many of the scenes simply do not matter. It is incredibly badly judged on almost every level. A strong contender for the worst film of the year, and certainly the most disappointing.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/366152395161485312">my Only God Forgives Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Kick-Ass 2</strong> manages to be even more nihilistically fun and gleefully violent than its predecessor, which is no easy task given the explosion of colour and carnage of the original. The main plot is about a supervillian uprising, funded by an unexpected source, and a group of vigilantes trying to stand up for normal people while realising they’re not playing a game. There’s a subplot following Hit Girl to high school which has some laughs, but is entirely superfluous to the main plot. On the whole, it’s hit-or-miss, but fun enough that it’s worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/372463768204095488">my Kick-Ass 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Lovelace</strong> is the dark story, based on her biography, of Linda Lovelace, the star of Deep Throat. It is first presented as a “fun” telling of her story (with enough warning signs to see what is coming), but the narrative doubles back to show the horrendous abuse she suffered, essentially being forced into the industry by her then husband. Peter Sarsgaard puts in a terrifically terrifying performance as the abuser, and Amanda Seyfried (an actress whose output I would normally avoid) is very believable as the abusee, showing real vulnerability. Very worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/372464514488221696">my Lovelace Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Elyisum</strong> is Neill Blomkamp’s first film since the very impressive District 9. How has he done with a bigger budget and better known cast? It’s certainly a grander presentation, but a much less effective story. As an allegory, it’s clunky and obvious, whilst as a straight-up story it’s inconsistent. Even the action sequences are, at best, hit-or miss. The physicality of District 9’s action (even though much of that was CG) gives way to some limp shoot-outs with gadgets that you will not care about. The film, tellingly, comes alive each time Sharlto Copley’s character, the main antagonist, is on-screen as he tears himself towards some goal through sheer force of will, even if we don’t care much about said goal. Mostly bad. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/373845463583039489">my Elysium Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>Lovelace</strong>. The performances were worth seeing, and the rest of the production wasn’t exactly slouching either.</p>

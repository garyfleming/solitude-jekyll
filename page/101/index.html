    <p>Despite being a comic genius, Steve Coogan’s acting ability can leave a lot to be desired. Take <strong>80 Days Around The World</strong>: a commercialised Jackie Chan film for kids with Coogan in the lead role. The results are quite underwelming.</p>

<p>So much so that I’ll say very little more about the film. A kids film gone wrong.</p>

    <p>People who know me know that I have a strong appreciation for zombie movies, the cheaper the better (although Dawn Of The Dead (the original) still holds the crown). I’m also fairly fond of overtly stylised Japanese gangster movies, or anything with a samurai. Copious amounts of comic blood is also a plus. So, when a film comes along and opens with a zombie being sliced in half by a samurai in an overly stylised way, and quickly brings in the Yakuza, I pay attention.</p>

<p><strong>Versus</strong> is that film.</p>

<p>The main elements of story can easily be glossed over (magical forest, legendary battles, history repeating, etc) and the film enjoyed purely for its cinematic veneer and ultra-violence aesthetic.</p>

<p>A truly outstanding film. Buy it, rent it, just see it.</p>

    <p>The first <strong>Spiderman</strong> film was simple, bordering on dumb. Despite that, it had some beautifully realised scenes (the spider-sense being triggered in the school hallway). The sequel is slightly smarter, but not in terms of the plot.</p>

<p>The direction subtly parodies classic films like King Kong, Godzilla and Evil Dead (which is hardly coincidental) in the framing of Octavius as a misunderstood monster. It works well.</p>

<p>The plot itself is somewhat cringeworthy, staying very much on the surface of the story arc while setting up plotlines for the next inevitable installment, without really getting anywhere. A shame given the richness of the backstory.</p>

<p>A reasonable film, certainly improving upon its predecessor in terms of cinematics, if not story.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Another documentary from the now infamous director Michael Moore, <strong>Fahrenheit 9/11</strong> discusses American internal security issues after the twin tower incident several years back.</p>

<p>Despite being somewhat informative and, in places, frightening, the main points are made through conspiracy theory-like circumstantial evidence and conjecture. Certainly the points made stand up (why were the Saudis allowed to freely leave the country when no-one else could?) but the reasons given are based on relatively flimsy evidence.</p>

<p>The tone of the film is also more patronising than should be expected from a serious documentary, dumbing everything down to the point of childishness.</p>

<p>It still remains a watchable film, but not one to be taken as absolute truth.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/07/29/Shrek2/">Shrek 2</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>While many sequels of late regurgitate the original’s jokes but louder (see the Austin Powers sequels for a prime example), <strong>Shrek 2</strong> is original and funny. Taking place not too long after the first film, the story doesn’t feel like a contrivance to get the characters back together for another adventure; a logical extension, rather than an embarrasingly tied together mess.</p>

<p>That’s enough analysis though. Primarily this is just a fun film to watch, with charm oozing from every perfectly thought out detail (the BK and Starbucks in Faraway land). The parodies and jokes are aimed at all levels, the “Cops” scene being particularly memorable.</p>

<p>All in all, a great film, only hampered by the slightly slow middle. Certainly one to see (like anyone won’t have by now).</p>

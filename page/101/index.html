  <div class="post">
    <p>A remake though it is, <strong>The Stepford Wives</strong> is a watchable film, if somewhat modest in its reinterpretation. There’s little of value since the original film, so one has to ask the obvious question: Why bother?</p>

<p>Personally, I’d like to have seen a Tim Burton take on it. Imagine a slightly camp, fifties style version (full of twee music, crackly pictures and men being men — rather than the Hollywood gloss version of the same). Then make it pervasively dark. The film could’ve been greatly improved simply by being more sinister, making the folks of Stepford that touch more unnerving through their pursuit of perfection and the American dream.</p>

<p>Worthwhile? Only if you’ve not seen the original.</p>

    <p>Despite being a comic genius, Steve Coogan’s acting ability can leave a lot to be desired. Take <strong>80 Days Around The World</strong>: a commercialised Jackie Chan film for kids with Coogan in the lead role. The results are quite underwelming.</p>

<p>So much so that I’ll say very little more about the film. A kids film gone wrong.</p>

    <p>People who know me know that I have a strong appreciation for zombie movies, the cheaper the better (although Dawn Of The Dead (the original) still holds the crown). I’m also fairly fond of overtly stylised Japanese gangster movies, or anything with a samurai. Copious amounts of comic blood is also a plus. So, when a film comes along and opens with a zombie being sliced in half by a samurai in an overly stylised way, and quickly brings in the Yakuza, I pay attention.</p>

<p><strong>Versus</strong> is that film.</p>

<p>The main elements of story can easily be glossed over (magical forest, legendary battles, history repeating, etc) and the film enjoyed purely for its cinematic veneer and ultra-violence aesthetic.</p>

<p>A truly outstanding film. Buy it, rent it, just see it.</p>

    <p>The first <strong>Spiderman</strong> film was simple, bordering on dumb. Despite that, it had some beautifully realised scenes (the spider-sense being triggered in the school hallway). The sequel is slightly smarter, but not in terms of the plot.</p>

<p>The direction subtly parodies classic films like King Kong, Godzilla and Evil Dead (which is hardly coincidental) in the framing of Octavius as a misunderstood monster. It works well.</p>

<p>The plot itself is somewhat cringeworthy, staying very much on the surface of the story arc while setting up plotlines for the next inevitable installment, without really getting anywhere. A shame given the richness of the backstory.</p>

<p>A reasonable film, certainly improving upon its predecessor in terms of cinematics, if not story.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/08/02/Fahrenheit911/">Fahrenheit 911</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Another documentary from the now infamous director Michael Moore, <strong>Fahrenheit 9/11</strong> discusses American internal security issues after the twin tower incident several years back.</p>

<p>Despite being somewhat informative and, in places, frightening, the main points are made through conspiracy theory-like circumstantial evidence and conjecture. Certainly the points made stand up (why were the Saudis allowed to freely leave the country when no-one else could?) but the reasons given are based on relatively flimsy evidence.</p>

<p>The tone of the film is also more patronising than should be expected from a serious documentary, dumbing everything down to the point of childishness.</p>

<p>It still remains a watchable film, but not one to be taken as absolute truth.</p>

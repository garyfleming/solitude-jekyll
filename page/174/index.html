    <p>I was looking through the referrer logs just a few minutes ago and found the most interesting entry: someone found me via Google by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=neds+noodles">searching for “neds” and “noodles”</a>. Bizarre.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t know my site had been indexed by Google at all.</p>

    <p>When someone first brought this to my attention, I thought it was a joke. It’s not.</p>

<p>Avril Lavigne (Queen of the posers) has covered a song by System Of A Down (Kings of modern metal). Yes, it’s as bad as it sounds.</p>

<p>I don’t want to scare people but here is the link <a href="http://www.crnw46307.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mp3/Avril_Lavigne-Chop_Suey_(System_Of_A_Down_Cover).mp3">Avril Lavigne – Chop Suey (Cover)</a>. I don’t know how long that link will stay up, so don’t hassle me if it stops working. Please exercise caution before listening – it will hurt.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/02/01/LackOfUpdates/">Lack Of Updates</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I haven’t been updating as much this week as I should be or have wanted to. It’s hard to discuss, comment or otherwise mention anything worthwhile when you’ve been having a pretty heavy week in the brain department.</p>

<p>First, the past week has been exam week at university. 3 maths exams, mostly difficult, at least partially my own fault. On the plus side, the three subjects I was sitting (Linear Algebra, Linear Modelling, and Graphs And Networks) are now over with. On the downside, I have another 3 courses starting on Monday – and that’s just maths.</p>

<p>Another major factor in the lack of updates is my <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>. I’ve been messing around – offline – with the way it stores and retrieves files. It’s got a few minor problems just now, but should be worked out soon (hopefully tonight). This might sound like a minor thing, but if I get it working the way I want it too it’ll fix the only major problem (scalability), allow posts to be found in different ways (by date, month, year among others) and generally just give me a few more toys to play with.</p>

<p>On a side note, I’m curious: what do people really want to see in a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>? I’ve developed this one almost entirely for myself, but what little features or major functions would you like to see? Send feedback to <a href="mailto:solitude@vkps.co.uk">my email address</a>.</p>

<p>The other thing that has been eating away at my time is <a href="http://www.challengetv.co.uk/ubb/Forum5/HTML/000059.html">Takeshi’s Castle</a>. Currently, it is showing on <a href="http://www.challengetv.co.uk/">Challenge TV</a> in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym>. Mad japanese people throw themselves through round after round of sheer torture. Highly amusing, for those who like to see people inflict pain on themselves via stupidity. The only question is: will anyone ever win? If so, what will they get?</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.jackie-chan.com/">Jackie Chan</a> has always been a favourite <del>actor</del> <ins>martial artist film-star</ins>. He moves with speed, skill and grace. Watching him use his comic fighting style is always a pleasure; watching him act is not.</p>

<p>So his English isn’t great, but that’s not the real problem. The worst thing about his films are the stories. No attempt to make a coherent or interesting plot is ever made. Everything is about getting Chan into ridiculous situations so he can fight people with ropes, plates and any other piece of scenery that he can carry at the time. That <em>is</em> a problem.</p>

<p>So, in the vain of <a href="http://www.fwfr.com/">Four Word Film Review</a>: Hire a real writer.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>If you’ve been here before (for any of the sites 2-3 week existence), you’ll have noticed a bit of a change. To be honest it was necessary. The last design took all of 2 hours to mark-up and design; hence it looked a bit shit.</p>

<p>This time I’ve spent a bit more time coming up with a design (probably about an hour – no major mark-up changes to bog me down) and had an idea of what I wanted the site to look like.</p>

<p>The idea was to go for a very minimalist look: clean solid blocks of colour, made slightly uneven by various techniques. Only 1 main colour was used, on top of the black and white (with a few other colours used in minor places), to really pull the visual design together.</p>

<p>Now, those of you using standards compliant browsers will see a little bit more than those using non-standards compliant browsers. It’s nothing essential (that would be bad for accessibility) but it does enhance the site. For an example, mouse-over the page heading “Solitude”. There are a few other minor touches like that scattered around – and more will be added when they enhance the site. Oh wait, you can’t see anything unusual? <strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix" title="Phoenix home page">Get a better browser</a></strong>.</p>

<p>While I was at it, I thought I’d make my site <a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/index.jsp">Bobby</a> 508 and AAA accessible, which nicely compliments the existing <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/"><acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Mark-up Language">XHTML</acronym></a>, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/"><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym></a> and <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Syndication/RSSnewsfeed.xml"><acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym></a> compliance. Showing off ends here.</p>

  <p class="author">

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Another massively late film fight, yes, but a good one.</p>

<p>November kicked off with the controversial <strong>Borat</strong> (yes, I can’t be arsed looking up the full and correct name). Enough has been said about this film: Sasha Baron Cohen travels around America as one of his alter-egos baiting people into saying some pretty awful things. It’s an amusing and tragic look at both the attitudes in some parts of our society and the way we choose to deal with them. I would say this is worth seeing regardless of whether or not you find the man’s work particularly amusing, as his subject’s are suitably horrifying.</p>

<p>Christopher Nolan keeps up his near unsullied record with <strong>The Prestige</strong>. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play magicians locked in a vicious feud, pressing forth the boundaries of magic, showmanship and dedication to their cause with the most poisonous venom. With the director’s usual sleight of hand present, excellent performances all round (including a cameo by David Bowie), and some fairly interesting set pieces, this is a masterful work, beautifully presented. A definite must-see.</p>

<p>After years of Bond heading towards mindless Hollywood action, full of cheap special effects and ludicrous adversaries, it is a pleasure to watch such a solid piece of cinema in the form of <strong>Casino Royale</strong>. With Brosnan ousted, Daniel Craig plays Bond like never before: as the determined government killer, torn by morality, that Ian Fleming always intended in his earliest works. Gone are the outlandish gadgets (for the most part), in are some fast cars and some of the best action sequences the series has yet to produce. Though the free-running inspired building site hunt is in stark contrast with the plodding pace throughout much of the casino material, the latter is bolstered by a few interesting twists. It’s not much of a compliment to say this is the best Bond movie since GoldenEye (which shared the same director) since the rest of the films were garbage, but perhaps it is worth saying it is likely to be in my top 5 bond films.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny</strong> has much of what you expect from a Jack Black comedy: a silly premise, executed warmly but lacking the really big laughs of his peers (such as Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller). The early scenes present few laughs, mostly rehashing material the band has previously used, but starts getting funnier towards the end. This is not much more than an extended music video for the band, so if you like them, go get the album and you’ll have a large chunk of the strongest material here.</p>

<p>In other months, Casino Royale would have won, but The Prestige is just such a great film that it was never going to get beaten, hard as Bond is.</p>

    <p>Raymond Chen has reasonably pointed out that most low-end users <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/27/1160055.aspx">don’t like using the search boxes</a> that modern browsers provide in addition to address bars. I couldn’t agree more.</p>

<p>The first thing I do with any new FireFox install, before loading up bookmarks or any of my favourite extensions, is to remove the search bar. Why?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ease of use. I don’t want to have to think about which box I’m going to use for a particular action, especially when the most common action is using Google: which works equally well in both boxes.</li>
  <li>Address bar is faster. Any time you move your hands from the keyboard to the mouse, you lose a significant portion of time. I don’t know if the search bar has a keyboard shortcut, but I know that the address bar does (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd>). Even if it does, how do I then quickly select a different search engine than the default?</li>
  <li>The address bar is multi-functional. I can use it for <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s and google, but if I add some keyword searches to my bookmarks (replace the query string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s</code> and add a keyword), then I can have any search engine I want at my finger tips.</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes the search box dead space in a prime location. It’s one (recent) saving is the addition of Google-style autocomplete. With a little more work this could, and should, be integrated into the address bar. At the very least, the option should be available.</p>

<p>So, what other things do I use the address bar quick search for?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://javadocs.org">Javadoc</a> – Look up any standard class with a quick “jdoc Class”.</li>
  <li><a href="http://man.splitbrain.org/">Man pages</a> – As with terminals, “man [program]” works just fine for looking up UNIX stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://acronymfinder.com">Acronyms</a> – Need to know what something means ASAP? “acronym ASAP” would do.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use it for dictionaries (“dic”), the thesaurus (“thes), torrents (“torr”), and just about any other common search because <em>it is better</em>. Give it a try.</p>

    <p>A reminder for myself for the future (and any other people doing Java development): using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like</code> operator in <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/">iBatis</a>. The meta character escaping you need in your <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">column like '%'||#property#||'%'</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">property</code> property is a bean property in your parameter class.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re doing everything in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where</code> clause dynamically, I would recommend looking at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dynamic</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isNotNull</code> tags.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2006/11/19/filmfightoctober2006/">Film Fight: October 2006</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Due to a silly number of other events in October, like a stupid number of birthdays (including, of course, <a href="/Archives/2006/10/24/ThisIs23">my own birthday</a>), I only saw three films in the cinema (though I did watch a decent number from my <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> backlog).</p>

<p>Will Ferrell hits the race track for his latest character film, <strong>Tallageda Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</strong>. This is exactly what you expect from a recent Ferrell film: a tale of a man who is top of his field hitting hard times and unexpected competition, having to re-learn and evaluate himself, and coming back stronger than ever, with a number of bizarre characters and memorable lines. While it fails to match previous efforts, like the excellent <strong>Anchorman</strong>, it’s still a worthwhile comedy if you like the lead’s goofy schtick.</p>

<p>Former Ferrell collaborator, Steve Carrell, plays it straight for once in delightful indie flick, <strong>Little Miss Sunshine</strong>. The story of a suburban family whose ties are wearing thing, the film follows them on a road trip across state to a (fairly nauseating) children’s beauty pageant. As with most good tales, the focus is on the journey, not the destination. The trials and breakdowns as they make their trip are tragic, hilarious and occassionally shocking. While a certain gloom hangs over areas of the film, it never lasts for long; the film serving as an affirmation of the tribulations of family life.</p>

<p>A couple of years back, the great Hong Kong crime trilogy, <strong><a href="/Archives/2004/03/05/InfernalAffairs">Infernal Affairs</a></strong>, kicked off. That is long since finished, but a heavyweight Hollywood version has appeared in the form of <strong>The Departed</strong>. The tale of a cop going undercover in a crime syndicate, and the same crime syndicating planting a mole in the cops, this version builds the same tension through paranoia and near-misses, with some excellent performances from Jack Nicholson and Leonardo Dicaprio. Although the dialogue is better (post-translation), it does go wayward in a few places (like the love story). Still a very worthy film.</p>

<p>It’s a tricky month, but I would say <strong>Little Miss Sunshine</strong> edges it.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2006/11/12/PlagiarismTokenisingPart1/">Plagiarism: Tokenising, Part 1</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After a long break since our <a href="/Archives/2006/10/17/PlagiarismIntroduction">plagiarism introduction</a>, it’s time to get started on the real work. I would go and get some coffee before reading, because this is going to take a while.</p>

<p>The first thing you really need to know about implementing a plagiarism detection system, and most natural language processors, is called <strong>tokenising</strong>: the process of taking a document and splitting it into smaller parts before the real analysis can take place.</p>

<p>What exactly do I mean by that? Say you have a 300 students all handing in essays or a piece of code (we will choose the latter simply because the syntax can be easier), and you want to compare them for the purpose of finding plagiarists. We’ll say that one of these pieces of code includes the line “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for i in 1..10 loop</code>“. The computer does not understand that snippet, or the language it is written in (ADA, incidentally). For it to compare it to other snippets, it must first do what the human brain has evolved to do naturally: split the sentences into words and extract meaning from the words. Without splitting up a page somewhat, you can understand it far less well than you can if you break it up, and you have less tolerance for slight differences when comparing documents. Same applies for the computer.</p>

<p>That’s not strictly true. The computer can just read those documents in as one big long string and compare them the dumb way, character by character. This, however, gives you much less tolerance for slight changes when comparing two very similar documents. A series of changes, even simple ones like adding spaces or punctuation, would make two very similar documents look different. This is a <strong>bad thing</strong>. We don’t want the cheaters to be able to beat our system by making small changes. If they make a lot of changes, that makes our life harder (are they still really cheating if they’ve changed everything?) but we certainly don’t want people them getting away with small changes.</p>

<p>So, we take the document, figure out what constitutes a “word” in the language of the document, and turn the document into a list of these “words”. We call these words <strong>tokens</strong>. We can compare tokens much more easily and efficiently than comparing full strings, and with more tolerance for change. So, our earlier example might be broken up like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["for", "i", "in", "1", "..", "10", "loop"]</code></p>

<p>Anyone who is being astute will notice that I just skipped over the real crux of the problem: how do we determine what a token is? Well, that really depends on the language that the document is in and, to an extent, the domain. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An essay written in English is very different from an essay written in Spanish.</li>
  <li>An essay written in English is very different from a Java source file.</li>
  <li>An essay about biology is likely very different (in language and style) from an essay about history.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you really need to understand about tokenising is that it is:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Language specific</strong> – in that to get anywhere worthwhile with your tokeninsing, you will need a different tokeniser for each language.</li>
  <li><strong>Domain specific</strong> – to get the most out of your tokeniser, it needs to be tuned to the domain of the topic (i.e. History, medicine etc) to better take advantage of how people in that domain exploit and use the language.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter of these two I will leave as an exercise to the reader, and not discuss much further. The former is the core of the problem we want to solve: how do we create a tokeniser for a specific language? Easy, we look at the <strong>grammar</strong> of the language.</p>

<p>Now, I know some people just shuddered at the mention of the word “grammar”, but it’s not so bad. The grammar for a language is simply the set of rules that allow for the construction of language features, a bunch of very simple rules that state which tokens can appear where and what form they should take when near other tokens. Thankfully, just about every computer language has a detailed specified grammar somewhere. If you’re suffering insomnia, have a look at the <a href="http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-P.html">Ada syntax</a> or the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/syntax.doc.html">Java grammar</a>. Thrilling stuff, I know.</p>

<p>You know your language, you have your grammar, now you need a <strong>parser</strong>. The parser takes the grammar and documents you provide, and spits out your tokens. This is a well-understood area, and you may even have some tools to do it for you. If not there are plenty of tools available that will parse for you: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yacc</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bison</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexx</code> are just a few command line tools that will parse documents. I would recommend <a href="http://sablecc.org/">SableCC</a> if you’re writing your plagiarism detection system in Java: it has a decent <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> and does most of the work for you. You just need to take the trees it produces (for compiler use), and flatten them into an array; a trivial task that amounts to an in-order walk.</p>

<p>Wow! We’ve now tokenised the document. End of story.</p>

<p>Well, not quite. The problem with using a pure parser-and-grammar approach is that it doesn’t work if your input (your code snippets or essays) are malformed. If even one part of your document breaks a rule, your parser is going to complain. Most will refuse to process it further. Handling this is your responsibility, and it’s not an easy problem to solve. The simplest solution I can suggest is falling back to white-space tokenising when something fails and logging the problem, feeding a better solution into the next version of your system. It’s hardly ideal. Also, always remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_Principle">Postel’s law</a> and consider that just because someone doesn’t fully follow the rules of a language, that does not mean they should get away with plagiarism.</p>

<p>Are we done now? No, but we’ve done enough for today. More tokenising soon.</p>

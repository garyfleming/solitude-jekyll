  <h3><a href="/Archives/2014/12/29/film-fight-2014-november/">Film Fight 2014: November</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

    <p>There are three films in the film fight for November…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Nightcrawler</strong> is a stylish, dark satire about the shock culture prevalent in modern journalism, particularly the nightly news. Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely nails the lead performance as a psychotic, but fascinating, camera man who will chase down any story; it might be a career best. The pacing is excellent: always pushing forward without being relentless, leaving the viewer gripped to their seat as the story unfolds. It’s made clear that the protagonist will do anything to get ahead, but it’s quite something to see exactly what he does. Exceptionally strong. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/530467873811349505">my Nightcrawler Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>As a fan of Christopher Nolan, it feels strange to say that <strong>Interstellar</strong> might be his weakest film. That’s not to say it’s bad, it just doesn’t live up to the high points he has elsewhere. The visuals are stunning, bringing clarity to any number of complex scenes and scenarios that involve astronomical phenomenon that are hard to comprehend. This bleeds over into the world-building which swiftly shows the end-of-days scenario playing out for humanity, and why the mission must go ahead. Despite the odd slow patch, the whole never feels like a three hour movie. All of that said, some of the dialogue is absolutely terrible, incredibly cringeworthy and painfully out of character speeches mar the otherwise good performances. Anne Hathaway’s speech in the middle is jarringly bad (due to the writing, not her performance). The central conceit in the plot (about love and family) doesn’t help much here either, turning a solid hard sci-fi film into an overly saccharine movie. Good, but flawed. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/531917506752303104">my Interstellar Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Snowpiercer</strong> is that rarest of things for a modern action film: clear. The linear set-up, of taking a train carriage by carriage, brings a clarity to the plot and action that is often missing in many movies. While the performances are solid (Tilda Swinton and Chris Evans in particular), it’s really the mix of different action sequences and the big, dark moment at the end that really make it all work. Mostly fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/531918092172288002">my Snowpiercer Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>Nightcrawler</strong>: well-paced, looks great, and with a top-class performance. Film of the year material.</p>

    <p>October was a busy month for me, so there is only one film in the Film Fight…</p>

<p>First and last up, <strong>Gone Girl</strong> is David Fincher’s latest, about a man who is accused of abducting and killing his missing wife. The pacing here is masterful, with each act taking the story in a different direction; moving from straight-up thriller to dark satire along the way. As you’d expect from Fincher, the whole thing looks gorgeous, with a golden sheen over all of those fixed camera shots. While the film is generally well-acted, there are a few of the smaller performances that are a bit broad, but nothing to really put you off. All in all a very good movie (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/523788534042599424">my Gone Girl Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The inevitable winner is, of course, <strong>Gone Girl</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2014/12/27/film-fight-2014-september/">Film Fight 2014: September</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>For September’s Film Fight, we have three films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Guest</strong> very quickly establishes that its tongue is firmly in cheek and that, despite the unease and tension in some scenes, it is not to be taken seriously. Doing this early was a good move, as it can then play scenes as knowing, rather than misjudged. The film finds just the right balance of dark comedy, home-intruder horror, and outright action for the mix to work. Enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/511144298780565504">my The Guest Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>While the slow burn of a spy thriller can be rewarding, <strong>A Most Wanted Man</strong> is not. It has the hallmarks of the genre: a slow, methodical build-up of misdirection, double-agents and deep-planning. It fails to pay-off on any of it. Maybe that was the intended punch-line, that sometimes these cat-and-mouse games don’t work, but to the viewer the lack of any real dramatic moment meant it was largely dull. Boring. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/514120622545567744">my A Most Wanted Man Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Before I Go To Sleep</strong> has a lingering and sad atmosphere, every scene filled up with a sense of mourning for a life that has been forgotten. Nicole Kidman is fantastic as a woman filling in the details of her former life day-on-day; with Colin Firth and Mark Strong both giving good performances. While the ending is overly saccharine, and oddly out of place, the majority of this film is excellent. Beautifully shot, well acted, and with an interesting narrative. Must watch.   (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/516699531397038082">my Before I Go To Sleep Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The obvious winner is <strong>Before I Go To Sleep</strong>, for its strong performances and great direction.</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Again, a few months late, but August’s Film Fight has 4 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong> represents a change of pace for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Where the earlier films are straight-faced without being dour, Guardians is out-and-out comic book crazy as we see the wider cosmic parts of the universe. The cast are great, managing to pull off fun action with genuinely funny moments; playing the right level of knowing insight into the absurdity of, for example, a tree that is best friends with a psychotic raccoon. The storytelling is a little exposition-heavy at times, but you won’t mind when everything else works so well. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/498511871331536896">my Guardians of the Galaxy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Inbetweeners 2</strong> is the result of extending a series way beyond breaking point. Where the series was funny, and the first film was okay, there’s barely anything left for a second film. There are a handful of horrible but funny moments, but most of the film is just the same reheated filler. Avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/501475567699767299">my The Inbetweeners 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Expendables 3</strong> is another sequel that should never have been made. As is par for the course, the opening and closing action sequences are big, extravagant indulgences that can be greatly entertaining. The problem is everything else: the awful acting, the terrible dialogue, bad pacing, pointless subplots etc. There’s very little to like when something isn’t exploding on screen. Also avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/501475946940346368">my The Expendables 3 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Rover</strong> is an exceptional, cold-blooded revenge thriller against the backdrop of a society that no longer has meaningful consequences. Set in a post apocalyptic world, reminiscent of The Road, Guy Pearce delivers one of his best performances as the not-quite-right lead. Brutal, relentless and breathtaking. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/505086998856884224">my The Rover Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>The Rover</strong> for being such a cold but gripping film.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2014/12/17/film-fight-2014-july/">Film Fight 2014: July</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Yup, they’re getting later and later at the moment, but here’s the Film Fight for July, with 4 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>How To Train Your Dragon 2</strong> is a fun-enough sequel to what was a pretty good kids movie. It’s not a masterpiece, feeling a little formulaic at times, but it really didn’t have to be a classic. There are sad moments, fun moments, exciting moments. It does its job of being an entertaining, if light-hearted, film. Enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/487890508900212736">my How To Train Your Dragon 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Boyhood</strong> is a fascinating experiment: director Richard Linklater assembled his cast every year for a few weeks, ostensibly so we can see the 7-year old boy at the centre of the film turn into a 19-year old man. While the pacing doesn’t always work, it’s great to see the actors improve year-on-year. While Ellar Coltrane, as the lead, sees the most obvious evolution, it’s great to see now-seasoned actors, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, going from serviceable at the start to great towards the end. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/488304043136389121">my Boyhood Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a surprisingly good reboot of the franchise, so it was going to be interesting to see where its sequel, <strong>Dawn of the Planet of The Apes</strong>, went next. There’s a significant time jump and the human population is all but wiped out as the film begins. A small group stumble into Caesar (the ape leader) and his new family, causing tensions to rise. While the supporting cast are sketched in overly broad strokes, the leads are well-drawn characters forced into worsening situations. There are a number of missteps (the music is overwrought, the apes using guns is never earned) but it remains entertaining. A solid action/adventure. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/492027135683751936">my Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Purge: Anarchy</strong> takes the silly premise of The Purge (that for one night a year no crime is illegal) into a new direction. Where the original was a home-invasion horror, Anarchy is more of a suspense-thriller, in the mould of Judgement Night. Viewed through that almost B-movie lens, it’s an entertaining film. There aren’t many surprises, but the action keeps the pace up nicely. Good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/494889666706165760">my The Purge: Anarchy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>For July, the winner is <strong>Boyhood</strong>, for being such an interesting cinematic undertaking.</p>

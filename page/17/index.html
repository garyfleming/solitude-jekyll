  <h3><a href="/2018/01/film-fight-2018-history-and-future/">Film Fight 2018: History and Future</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’ve been writing about the films I’ve seen for almost 15 years. The first review
was on January 28th, 2003, covering the fairly terrible Jackie Chan movie, <strong><a href="https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/01/28/thetuxedo/">The Tuxedo</a></strong>. That was
about a fortnight after I started this blog.</p>

<p>I’ve had a Cineworld Unlimited card for almost as long, from around February 2003.
It was originally a UGC Unlimited card, but let’s not quibble on the details.
Since then I’ve tried to watch at least a film a week in the cinema and have done
a pretty decent job of keeping that up.</p>

<p>Two years later, in January 2005, I said I’d <a href="https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2005/01/03/Changes2005PartThreeRenew/">stop writing film reviews</a>,
at least in part because I was struggling to keep up with writing a few paragraphs
on each film. That’s how the <a href="https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2005/01/31/filmfightjanuary2005/">first Film Fight</a> was
born: a new format to lighten the load a little.</p>

<p>The idea was to write a single paragraph for each film released in a month,
and write about all of the films in one post. I can’t remember why, but I decided
to pick a “best” film each month and then, from those monthly winners, a best film
of the year. Now, this contest aspect has never been something I’ve taken too seriously.
There are good and bad films, but mostly films are contextual. I’m not going
to love the best drama of the year if I’m in the mood for comedy.</p>

<p>Anyway, in 2009 I decided to tweet about the films too. Within a few days of
seeing them, I’d tweet a short 140 character review, and then put a link to that
tweet at the end of the monthly Film Fight. That seemed like a good idea.</p>

<p>Jump forward 9 years, and the format hasn’t changed much. It’s still a single
paragraph, with a link to a tweet, in a silly knockout competition format once
per month.</p>

<p>Well, that’s not quite correct: for the last few years, I’ve struggled to keep
up with even the monthly schedule. My time is going into other things (family,
tech community, writing talks, other interests etc). With Netflix also putting
out far more original movies, the problem is worsening.</p>

<p>(As an aside, the Netflix originals being included meant someone asked me what
was eligible for Film Fight. My rule of thumb has always been it has to be the
first realistic chance I’d have to see a film. For a cinema release, that’s from
the day of release to it disappearing from cinemas. Re-releases don’t count. If
I made it to a special advanced screening or preview, that’d be allowed in, but
if I didn’t make it the film wouldn’t be excluded at it’s main release. For
non-cinematic releases (Netflix, straight to video, or VOD), my rule of thumb has
been a month since its original release.)</p>

<p>Given I’m not keeping up with the reviews, it’s time for another change. So what
am I going to do? Given Twitter have increased the length of
tweets to 280 characters, I’m going to embrace that. Where needed, the Twitter
reviews will no longer stick to the 140ish characters as before, and will take up
the full space available. The monthly posts will then just be an amalgamation of
those longer tweets, with a monthly winner picked at the end. That’s much easier
to keep up with, I hope.</p>

<p>Finally, I <em>might</em> start doing something I’ve considered over the years: longer
one-off pieces on films that I think warrant it, where the tweet doesn’t feel
like enough. We’ll see.</p>

<p>So, that is what’s ahead for Film Fight. Onwards…</p>

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Another mostly very late Film Fight comes to a close for 2017. As per <a href="https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/2016/12/film-fight-2016-finale/">my perennial caveat</a>, Film Fight is done in
a knock-out style: it can pick a first place, but everything else is unknown.</p>

<p>First up, the honourable mentions: films that were good but didn’t win their month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jackie</li>
  <li>T2: Trainspotting</li>
  <li>The Lego Batman Movie</li>
  <li>John Wick: Chapter 2</li>
  <li>Moonlight</li>
  <li>The Founder</li>
  <li>I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore</li>
  <li>Imperial Dreams</li>
  <li>Logan</li>
  <li>Burning Sands</li>
  <li>The Discovery</li>
  <li>Win It All</li>
  <li>The Handmaiden</li>
  <li>In The Shadow of Iris</li>
  <li>Wonder Woman</li>
  <li>Spiderman: Homecoming</li>
  <li>To The Bone</li>
  <li>The Incredible Jessica James</li>
  <li>Message From The King</li>
  <li>Logan Lucky</li>
  <li>First They Killed My Father</li>
  <li>The Death of Stalin</li>
  <li>Bomb Scared</li>
  <li>1922</li>
  <li>Wheelman</li>
  <li>Bright</li>
</ul>

<p>And the monthly winners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: <strong>Manchester By Sea</strong></li>
  <li>February: <strong>Fences</strong></li>
  <li>March: <strong>Get Out</strong></li>
  <li>April: <strong>Free Fire</strong></li>
  <li>May: <strong>Colossal</strong></li>
  <li>June: <strong>Baby Driver</strong></li>
  <li>July: <strong>Dunkirk</strong></li>
  <li>August: <strong>Atomic Blonde</strong></li>
  <li>September: <strong>mother!</strong></li>
  <li>October: <strong>Bladerunner 2049</strong></li>
  <li>November: <strong>The Florida Project</strong></li>
  <li>December: <strong>The Disaster Artist</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know if it is a reflection of available cinematic fare or just my own mood
and inclination, but it feels like I saw fewer dramas this year and far more easy
watches. That’s something that I’ll look to counter next year.</p>

<p>Given what I did see, there are some films that made it through in a weak month but enough
solid contenders that this is still tricky.</p>

<p>Denzel Washington was fantastic on both sides of the camera in <strong>Fences</strong>, with a
character he really sun his teeth into. Yes, it always feels like a stage adaptation (it is),
but that lets the actors focus more on their performance, delivering some excellent dialogue.</p>

<p><strong>Get Out</strong> was an incredible piece of work for Jordan Peele’s debut feature. Part horror, part
social commentary, and every bit of it smartly done. There are numerous obvious and subtle
callbacks running through it that will require multiple viewings to appreciate. Very
satisfying.</p>

<p>Both <strong>Dunkirk</strong> and <strong>mother!</strong>, in their own ways, delivered visceral experiences; through
sound and movement showing what a cinematic overload can do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <strong>Colossal</strong> and <strong>The Florida Project</strong> tackle big issues in very different ways.
The former is fantastical, while the latter is grounded, but no less beautiful.</p>

<p>For the winner, I’m torn between two very different films. The Florida Project stuck with
me for a long time, and delivers a fantastic message. That said, I think the winner delivers
big too, but juggles a message and entertainment perfectly. That is why <strong>Get Out</strong> is the
Film Fight 2017 winner.</p>

    <p>The last Film Fight of the year sees five films try to get that final place…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>6 Days</strong> is a dramatic retelling of the 1980 siege of the Iranian Embassy in London. It doesn’t quite work. The runtime doesn’t allow it to build out the plot too much, and most of the characters are left as sketches. The attempts to build tension (leaving a critical phone ringing for too long, for example) are ineffective and cliched. It’s not entirely a waste of time, but is somewhat forgettable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/939824795729793024">my 6 Days Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>James and Dave Franco do a great job of humanising the making of notorious B-movie, The Room, in the strangely good <strong>The Disaster Artist</strong>. The how and why of The Room is compelling enough, but James Franco is fantastic as Tommy Wiseau, the strange figure who starred in, wrote, and directed it. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/940274393401438209">my The Disaster Artist Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>It seems like <strong>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</strong> has divided viewers. Some people seem to think it was amazing and others seem to think it was terrible. I thought it was pretty average. It’s <em>far</em> too long, with a number of aimless b-plots in there to service characters who would’ve been better off left on the benches. The plot holes are glaring from the start, but the universe and main cast are interesting enough to overcome that. It’s fun, but far from the best the series has to offer. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/942402312005472261">my Star Wars: The Last Jedi Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>As Netflix’s biggest bet to date, there’s a lot of interest around <strong>Bright</strong>. Set in a modern day Los Angeles where fantasy creatures (Orcs, Elves, fairies) have been common-place for thousands of years, Bright follows the first Orc to become a police officer and his partner (Will Smith). At times the world-building is a little expositional, but it helps develop a rich setting around some fun action. It’s flawed, for sure, but is very watchable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944998691202650112">my Bright Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>El Camino Christmas</strong> is a low-budget Christmas film, suffering from a so-so script. It’s not TV movie bad, but it’s not great. The most notable thing in it is Tim Allen who, despite having little to work with, delivers a far better performance than was needed. Lightweight, throw-away, okay. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944998966030229505">my El Camino Christmas Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for December is <strong>The Disaster Artist</strong>. It’s not exceptional, but does tell a weird and interesting story.</p>

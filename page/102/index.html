  <div class="post">
    <p>After a 2 month venture to Nottingham, I’m back. Although it was originally going to be there for a year, I decided that the job simply wasn’t what I wanted to do. I’m unsure about specifically mentioning the company I worked for (very big company, one of the biggest in the world), but for those who know (or can figure out) who I mean I’d like to say that they are a great company to work for and really look out for their people. It just wasn’t meant to be.</p>

<p>Anyway, onwards. Solitude will return with more than film reviews (all I could really get away with posting); there are a shedload of links waiting to be put into a link post, and I’m sure I’ll have a few things to say about tech.</p>

<p>For the moment, let me tell you a few things I’ve learned and realised over the last few months.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beeston, the area of Nottingham in which I lived, has far too many pizza places for them all to stay afloat legitimately.</li>
  <li>Nottingham itself is a beautiful city (even if it does have far too many shoe shops).</li>
  <li>There are so many good bars and clubs in Nottingham, especially for rock fans. I heartily recommend <a href="http://www.cookieclub.co.uk/">The Cookie Club</a> on a Saturday, as well as <a href="http://www.rock-city.co.uk/">Rock City</a>.</li>
  <li>Although I’m a master chef, I hate cooking. Especially in the morning.</li>
  <li>“<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099453983/qid=1093609534/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-4853879-0585203">Diary</a>“, by Chuck Palahniuk, is an incredible read.</li>
  <li>I am a compulsive list writer. Until recently, I had denied and hidden this trait but I have too many lists to continue doing so.</li>
  <li>Anytime I go to London something goes wrong. Every time.</li>
  <li>Art, in any form, is exactly what you take from it. Don’t let anyone, not even the artist, tell you any different.</li>
  <li>Language is fundamentally tied to culture. To truly understand one, you have to grasp both.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mclusky.net/">Mclusky</a> would be the new hotness, if it were not for the fact that they’re not that new or hot. They’ll have to put up with being an outstanding band, with an unrivalled live ferocity and a style that is both comical and stone serious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expect more on some of those at a later date. For now, I’m off to catch up with some <a href="http://iratescotsman.com" title="Matt Gemmel's site">old</a> <a href="http://chris-miller.org/blog/index.php" title="Chris Miller's site">friends</a>.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>A remake though it is, <strong>The Stepford Wives</strong> is a watchable film, if somewhat modest in its reinterpretation. There’s little of value since the original film, so one has to ask the obvious question: Why bother?</p>

<p>Personally, I’d like to have seen a Tim Burton take on it. Imagine a slightly camp, fifties style version (full of twee music, crackly pictures and men being men — rather than the Hollywood gloss version of the same). Then make it pervasively dark. The film could’ve been greatly improved simply by being more sinister, making the folks of Stepford that touch more unnerving through their pursuit of perfection and the American dream.</p>

<p>Worthwhile? Only if you’ve not seen the original.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Despite being a comic genius, Steve Coogan’s acting ability can leave a lot to be desired. Take <strong>80 Days Around The World</strong>: a commercialised Jackie Chan film for kids with Coogan in the lead role. The results are quite underwelming.</p>

<p>So much so that I’ll say very little more about the film. A kids film gone wrong.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>People who know me know that I have a strong appreciation for zombie movies, the cheaper the better (although Dawn Of The Dead (the original) still holds the crown). I’m also fairly fond of overtly stylised Japanese gangster movies, or anything with a samurai. Copious amounts of comic blood is also a plus. So, when a film comes along and opens with a zombie being sliced in half by a samurai in an overly stylised way, and quickly brings in the Yakuza, I pay attention.</p>

<p><strong>Versus</strong> is that film.</p>

<p>The main elements of story can easily be glossed over (magical forest, legendary battles, history repeating, etc) and the film enjoyed purely for its cinematic veneer and ultra-violence aesthetic.</p>

<p>A truly outstanding film. Buy it, rent it, just see it.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/08/12/spiderman2/">Spiderman 2</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The first <strong>Spiderman</strong> film was simple, bordering on dumb. Despite that, it had some beautifully realised scenes (the spider-sense being triggered in the school hallway). The sequel is slightly smarter, but not in terms of the plot.</p>

<p>The direction subtly parodies classic films like King Kong, Godzilla and Evil Dead (which is hardly coincidental) in the framing of Octavius as a misunderstood monster. It works well.</p>

<p>The plot itself is somewhat cringeworthy, staying very much on the surface of the story arc while setting up plotlines for the next inevitable installment, without really getting anywhere. A shame given the richness of the backstory.</p>

<p>A reasonable film, certainly improving upon its predecessor in terms of cinematics, if not story.</p>

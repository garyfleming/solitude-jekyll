    <p>After hours of trying to get it to work online and offline simultaneously, I’ve finally managed to change the permalinks around here to something approaching respectable. They’re now in the form “/Archives/Year/Month/Day/#Title” rather than the Google-incompatible “/News/Archives?ArtID=YearMonthDayTime”. The first time I tried it (a few weeks ago), I ended up crashing one of my servers. Now that my exams are over with, I’ve had time to clear my head and solve the problem.</p>

<p>Why did it take so long? Well, I had to fork two very subtly different versions of .htaccess to serve up each new <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym> to each server. Then I had to make sure that every conceivable permalink that has been used in the past is still compatible (there are a lot of variations and it’s a non-trivial job); they all do. Then I had to change the templates and archive code to actually output the new <span class="caps">URI</span>. There’s more, but I won’t bore you further.</p>

<p>The best part, though, is that there is an even better permalink scheme on the way: providing incredibly flexible and intuitive paths (yes, it will be able to figure out any relevant crap you throw at it), while remaining completely compatible with this scheme.</p>

<p>Also note, the links in the main navigation are all in the <span class="caps">URI</span> form now, but will still work with the older paths.</p>

    <p>Things that I found out in roughly the space of a day:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bourbon creams (king among biscuits) are better the cheaper they are. A 29p packet outclasses all challengers.</li>
  <li>“That is <em>not</em> a weed – it’s a carrot”, despite looking very weedy.</li>
  <li>A friend (admittedly not an extremely close one, but a friend nonetheless) might end up homeless within a week because of another friends procastination.</li>
  <li><strong>Silent Scope Fortune Hunter</strong> might as well be a bank machine. It’s so easy to take money out in small bursts. Repeat enough times and you have a considerable wad of cash.</li>
  <li>If someone says “Yes, we’ll change those account details for you before you get paid”, they really mean “This request will be binned. You’ll have to try again next month”.</li>
  <li><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Stowe,Madeleine">Madeleine Stowe</a> looks somewhat like <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Blanchett,Cate">Cate Blanchett</a> as a blonde in <strong>Twelve Monkeys</strong>, apparently.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest has been removed to protect the innocent.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, I finally had my last exam. It’s been a long few weeks, I’m tired (as has been pointed out by more than one person) and I need this break. Thankfully, I’ve got the next 3 months off university.</p>

<p>What will I be doing to fill time? Learning a plethora of new languages (brushing up on javascript, <acronym title="Extensible User Interface Language">XUL</acronym>, Python, Java, C and a few others), working on new features for this site and Finetto (particularly comments and <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> stuff), working (gotta get some cash) and listening to a lot of music.</p>

<p>Full updates return on Monday (or perhaps sunday).</p>

    <p>Right, this <em>will</em> be the last <strong>Matrix</strong> post in a long time. This time some guy is trying to <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/btakle/matrix_reloaded.html">explain The Matrix Reloaded</a>.</p>

<p>I haven’t read the whole thing yet but, despite the craziness in places, it makes a lot of sense. Worth a read.</p>

    <p>This week marks my last batch of exams for this session at university (thankfully). So, while huge updates will be appearing over the forthcoming months of summer nothingness, the next week will see this place almost turned into a desert. Sorry, but it’s going to be an intense few days of studying, catching up with people who I’ve had to side-line for the past few weeks, and generally celebrating the end.</p>

<p>After that though, big things. Including, but not limited to, an idea I’ve had for a long time now which will amount to an entirely new way of looking at this site. But that is then and this is now.</p>

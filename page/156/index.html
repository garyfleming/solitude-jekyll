    <p>After 2 poor support bands and a far-from-capacity crowd, <a href="http://www.coopertempleclause.com"><strong>The Cooper Temple Clause</strong></a> were going to have to pull out something special to make it a worthwhile night. While they didn’t fully succeed in making it a fantastic gig, it was fun.</p>

<p>Despite playing too many new songs to begin with (“Promises, Promises” sounding good), they got going when songs from <em>See This Through And Leave</em> started flowing more freely. Best moment was the double-whammy of <em>Film-maker</em>/<em>Been Training Dogs</em>, easing into the last part of the set.</p>

<p>Even though the crowd clearly wanted more, they band didn’t play a very long set (around an hour) and no encore. On that front, they have to be looked down on.</p>

    <p>I came across <a href="http://blogs.iloha.net/ryochiji/" title="Ryochiji's Blog">Ryochiji’s</a> interesting new blog-matching site called, surprisingly, <a href="http://blogmatcher.com/">BlogMatcher</a> (via <a href="http://www.mrry.co.uk/">mrry</a>). It indexes blogs that ping <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a> and finds similarity in links. You, the imaginary user, then come along and give it a blog to find matches for. It then provides you with a list of similar sites.</p>

<p>Most of <a href="http://blogmatcher.com/j.php?url1=http%3A%2F%2Fsolitude.vkps.co.uk">my BlogMatched sites</a> focus on <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and other similar issues; not surprisingly, considering how tired I am of writing that acronym – really need to automate that. There are a few entries on random stuff (<a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030506232303" title="Review of X-men 2">Halle Berry</a>, <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030503234319">Dreamcatcher</a>, etc) as well.</p>

<p>Also, I hate <a href="http://www.blogshares.com">BlogShares</a>. I started playing a month or two ago for 10-15 minutes a day; slowly amassing money. And then I bought into <a href="http://omor.com/b/">FSP 1.1</a>. Shares bought at $15.63 have dropped to $0.81, scrubbing $800 from my pockets. DAMMIT! Oh well, I made a grand on another site overnight so karma balanced.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been reading about <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=892542">Uberman’s Sleep Schedule</a> – a way of hot-wiring your brain into allowing 2 hours sleep a day. I don’t think I could make it work just now (where could I sleep at university every 4 hours?), but might experiment a bit during the summer.</p>

<p>There was more, but it’s gone for now.</p>

    <p>Further to my post about <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030509234103">Content Sent Correctly</a>, I’ve been added to Evan’s list of sites that pass all 3 tests called “<a href="http://www.goer.org/Markup/TheXPhiles/">The X-Philes</a>“. So far, only 11 sites are on that list.</p>

<p>What I didn’t mention before-hand, is that there is actually a 4th test: Why do you use <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>? So thought it might be worth answering that one, even if it isn’t necessary.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>To learn</strong> – the best way to learn a new technology, for better or worse, is to use it in a practical application. For XHTML, that means building a website,</li>
  <li><strong>Because XHTML is <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym></strong> – I like XML. It’s well-formed, logical, and if something isn’t how you wanted it to be, it’s probably your fault (rather than a browser bug, as is usually the case in <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>). It’s also scrappable. If I want to extract any part of my markup without going to stupid lengths, I can do so with any XML parser,</li>
  <li><strong>It’s semantically richer</strong> – no more name tag, only one language attribute, and lots more redundancy is gone.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m sure there are other reasons that I’ve forgotten for now, but I think those are sufficient reasons.</p>

    <p>The single greatest innovation of recent times: <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/crawl.php3">automated pub crawling</a>. Just give it some location data (post code, or city name) and it’ll generate a random pub crawl for you to go on. It changes every time, so the alcoholics (read: students) out there will never get bored. Isn’t technology wonderful?</p>

    <p>A few days ago, I read about a test someone was doing on various sites. The <a href="http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/Apr/index.html#29">test showed</a> that of 119 sites tested, only 1 site had fully conformed to <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>. So, I wanted to see if this site passed the tests.</p>

<p>The first two were easy: every page on this site validates as XHTML 1.1 (or it damn well should). The last one was a known problem: sending the pages you read as <em>application/xhtml+xml</em> rather than <em>text/html</em>. So off I went to find a solution.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before I found <cite>Mark Pilgrim’s</cite> <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/19/dive-into-xml.html">Road To XHTML 2.0: MIME types</a>, which included a trivial piece of <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> that would solve my problems. It was quickly added to my headers.</p>

<p>Now, this change to my PHP meant that browsers who could accept the correct MIME type got that sent to them, others (like <acronym title="Internet Explorer/Windows">IE/WIN</acronym>) got a normal MIME type that wouldn’t strain them.</p>

<p>Everything was going fine until I had to edit a post (I never spell-check this until well after entries go online). The editing feature of my <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> bawked at the new MIME-type. Why? Because browsers refuse to display any XHTML in a textarea when you use the proper MIME-type, leaving me screwed since my CMS dumps XHTML straight into a textarea to be manipulated.</p>

<p>After a bit of fudging, it all works. I can hardly wait for a new bunch of problems when <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xhtml2-20030506/">XHTML 2.0</a> hits.</p>

<p><ins>Sorry for how boring this all turned out. I’m a little ill today, and it seemed interesting when I started writing. Oh, how wrong.</ins></p>

    <p>Partly via <a href="http://www.waxy.org">Waxy.org</a> comes news that <a href="http://www.archive.org">Archive.org</a> has some excellent new features (or maybe this is me just noticing them).</p>

<p>First up is the new movie archive featuring such classics as <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=feature_films&amp;collectionid=night_of_the_living_dead">Night Of The Living Dead</a>, to download for free. Most of the films are extremely old, but the price is right.</p>

<p>Also excellent is the new <a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/etree.php">Live Music Archive</a>, featuring full live sets in the shorten format. Although I hadn’t heard of most of the bands, it has some hidden gems like 19 Tenacious D sets. For free. Take that record industry fools.</p>

<p>I had previously never heard of the shorten format, but do a quick google search for it and everything you need to know about listening to, creating and decompressing .shn files becomes available.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>In a story about infamous London gangster, Charlie Richardson, you might expect to hear about his rise to power, the struggles he had with rivals, set-ups for his ultimate fall when finally sent to jail; the film <strong>Charlie</strong> is not like this at all.</p>

<p>Lacking real focus, the film instead looks at anecdotes relating to the testimony given against him and, more often, other short tales of his criminal endeavours that are largely unrelated.</p>

<p>Although the film is clearly biased towards his version of events, we never really see a hero (or anti-hero) emerge, leaving the film sadly lacking in terms of character and plot. Certainly, we learn something of the man, but never enough to really make us care either way, no struggle, no interest.</p>

<p>While <strong>Luke Goss</strong> puts in a strong visual performance as the title role, his faux-cockney accent grates and ultimately taints the whole film.</p>

<p>Sub-par ganster action, but not entirely without merit.</p>

    <p>For no real reason I was looking at the ZSh man page and found this gem of paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A userguide is currently in preparation. It is intended to complement the manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be cabbalistic, hierographic and, or downright mystifying (for example, the word ‘heirographic’ does not exist).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something about self-referencing humour that makes the English geek in me smile.</p>

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>After some recent downtime, <a href="/Code/ActoRss/">ActoRss</a> is now fully functioning. For anyone who is unaware, it is a system to get an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed for the latest films an actor has appeared in (or will appear in).</p>

<p>I took the opportunity to rework the original code, with the following improvements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Faster</strong> – Although still a little on the slow side (due to the proxy nature of screen scraping), this version is much faster than the previous.</li>
  <li><strong>Error Correction</strong> – If you mispell an actor’s name, it will try to find the nearest, most relevant match.</li>
  <li><strong>Atom Enabled</strong> – You can now get your feed in the Atom format. Although I’m unhappy with some of the constraints Atom places on such a simple feed (modified and issued dates are unknown and irrelevant), I’d rather leave it up to the users to pick their format.</li>
  <li><strong>Directors</strong> – You can now also get feeds for directors, sound engineers, visual effects supervisors… If they’ve warranted a page on <a href="http://us.imdb.com">imdb</a>, you can get a feed for them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I know that those last two improvements make a mockery of the name (since it’s now no longer solely about actors and RSS), it just seemed like the obvious extension to the existing version. Hope people enjoy it.</p>

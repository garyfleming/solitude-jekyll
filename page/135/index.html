  <div class="post">
    <p>There are two ways of looking at <strong><a href="http://www.entertheunderworld.com">Underworld</a></strong>: either as a mindless, yet stylised action film that happens to have vampires and werewolves as the protagonists, or as overblown convoluted tripe (with fights).</p>

<p>I tend to side with the former. Enough action to stop thinking is good sometimes.</p>

<p>The acting in the film is, however, appalling, as is the character interactions. Very formulaic stuff. Just don’t go expecting a work of genius and you’ll be ok.</p>

    <p>Time for another round of random links (if I get time, I’m going to create some basic link sidebar scripts – then I won’t wait a few days until I have several new entries before posting):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/issues/2003-09-17/music.html/1/index.html">Radiohead Rorscach</a></strong> – What would happen if you played Radiohead’s choice moments to a bunch of school kids and asked them to draw? Some very frightening and funny things.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.nerve.com/regulars/quickies/unsexy/">50 Unsexiest Things</a></strong> – While I can’t agree with all of them, most are pretty on the money.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.benmeadowcroft.com/webdev/articles/abbr-vs-acronym.shtml">Abbr Vs Acronym again</a></strong> – One markup debate that I’m still not settled on. I currently use acronym for everything. This might (read: probably will) change. But life is far too short to obsess over this.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.babysimon.co.uk/khtml2png/">K<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>2PNG</a></strong> – Create thumbnails of websites. Fantastic! Just wish I was still using Linux as my default OS (until I get a new modem, it’s not going to happen).</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://editcss.mozdev.org/">Firebird edit<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym></a></strong> – Modify loaded stylesheets in browser. Great idea, can’t seem to get it to work in my (admittedly old) Phoenix install.</li>

  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I didn’t initially hold out a lot of hope for <strong>The Italian Job</strong> remake. It seemed pointless, if not outright stupid, to recreate such a well-loved, classic film. Later, it became abundantly clear that they were using the name, the minis, and a few minor details.</p>

<p>A cash-in, then.</p>

<p>Unfortunate, certainly, but not entirely worthless. Judging the film on its own merits, it’s a very slightly above par film, marred only by how painfully slick it is. The amount of Hollywood polish begins to detract.</p>

<p>The film also suffers severely from trailer trashing; the practice of putting all the good bits in the trailer, thus ruining a lot of the film for those who remember the trailer.</p>

<p>All in all, not as bad as I expected, but nowhere near the original.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>There’s not a lot to be said about <strong>Tears Of The Sun</strong>. The action is weak qualitatively and quantitively, with little plot and less acting to back them up. Waving such flags as “soldier does the right thing”, and “do the mission, whatever it takes”, it does a poor job of actually making you care. When people die, you shrug and go back to sleep.</p>

<p>Dull, mediocre (at best), superficial junk. Don’t see.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2003/09/23/ImprovingComments/">Improving Comments</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Based (in part) on advice from the insanely smart <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/index.shtml">Jacques Distler</a>, I made a list of 7 things to do that would improve my commenting system. I had intended on doing at least 6 of them yesterday (the last one being quite difficult, taking at least a day on its own). As should have been expected, I got a little sidetracked. Damn you, Knights Of The Old Republic!</p>

<p>I did, however, get 2 of those features done. First up is comment counts, making it easier to see if someone has commented on an entry on the front page (chances are they haven’t, but hey, that’s life).</p>

<p>Secondly is much better error handling. Rather than outright reject a comment if it doesn’t resolve as valid <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>, I now redisplay the form with all the fields as they were, with helpful advice on what is invalid.</p>

<p>The other features will probably appear more slowly over the course of the next fortnight as university starts back and I’ve got a backlog of work to do.</p>

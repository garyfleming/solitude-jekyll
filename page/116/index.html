    <p>A (comparatively) short review of <strong>The Dreamers</strong>: unengaging, self-involved, border-line pretentious, near-arthouse garbage.</p>

<p>This ground has been treaded before, down less smug avenues; in ways that aren’t overtly dull. Avoid.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Finally there is a prepay 3G mobile plan in the UK. <a href="http://www.three.co.uk">Three</a> have unveiled their top-up based system, no longer requiring huge contracts for the new features.</p>

<p>As expected, there is a catch. Or two.</p>

<p>It’s expensive compared to other mobile companies. If you have no motivation to constantly use the video features, it might not work out well. It’s 15p per text message to other networks, and with added complications (the first £1.50 of your credit is priced differently), the pricing structure is bloated.</p>

<p>The other main set-back is that all credit has to be used within 30 days of activating it or it gets removed. That’s right, you’re effectively having your money swiped out from under you if you’re a little lax one month. This is the same trick the first prepay mobile plans tried to use to leverage wallets. It failed. You would think Three had learned the lessons of the past.</p>

<p>Seems like a good idea on the surface, but hold off another few months and maybe they’ll get the pricing under control and remove the restraints.</p>

    <p>From the trailers it is easy to imagine Tim Burton’s new film, <strong>Big Fish</strong>, as just being more Hollywood fantasy tripe, with about as much depth as <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/08/19/Chicago">Chicago</a> (how I love that film).</p>

<p>Surprising, then, is the fact that Big Fish is actually quite entertaining.</p>

<p>It’s not laugh out loud funny, but the tall tales being woven into a bizarre cornucopia of imagery and tangents. The bit parts are fantastically acted, even if Ewan McGregor’s accent is a little irritating.</p>

<p>A good film, that managed to surpass low expectations.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/02/20/SchoolOfRock/">School Of Rock</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Slightly formulaic, but still amusing, <strong>School Of Rock</strong> is exactly what you might expect.</p>

<p>The plot focusses around <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0085312/">Jack Black</a> trying to teach some school kids to rock. You know what to expect, he helps a few of them through hard times in their life, and helps them to loosen up. They, in turn, teach him to grow up.</p>

<p>Despite the predictable, back of a matchbox script, it is still fairly amusing. This can be attributed more to the charm and energy that Black puts into his perfomances, than to the jokes themselves. Either way, though, it is well worth watching.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.ifilm.com/confessions/">Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind</a> is an odd film. Beginning as the tale of real game show creator, <a href="http://chuckbarris.thegongshow1976.com">Chuck Barris</a> , it starts to deviate from reality. Or does it?</p>

<p>Although nothing has been (or will be) confirmed in reality, it’s unlikely that Mr Barris was really a <acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> trained assassin. But because the question can’t be answered, it reminds me somewhat of <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Archives.php?ArtID=20030308230633">Adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Both films begin to blur the reality that we are faced with in the cinema. “Is what we are seeing real or is it fiction?” is no longer the question. It’s what <em>pieces</em> really happened and which didn’t. With more than a hint of truth in every lie, it’s hard to tell the exact concentration of reality we’re seeing.</p>

    <p>A few changes around the back-end of the site:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>G-ZIP Enabled</strong> – If you have a relatively modern browser, then the site will now download up to twice as fast as before, thanks to the magic of <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>‘s built-in <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-gzhandler.php">g-zip output buffering function</a>. I’ve known about it for a while, but have been reluctant to activate it because part of Finetto uses it’s own output buffer. I thought they might be incompatible. I was wrong, both work fine.</li>
  <li><strong>Pinging <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a></strong> – I’ve started pinging <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a> and incorporated the functions into Finetto. Every time I updated, weblogs.com can tell others about it within 5 minutes (roughly how often it takes them to change their log file).</li>
  <li>There was something else, but I forgot so this point is useless. Ignore it.</li>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Right from the outset, the most annoying thing about going to see “The Recruit” was having seen the trailer. Now, you might be thinking that if I thought the trailer was bad, then I shouldn’t have gone in the first place and should stop my incessant moaning. But you’d be wrong. I didn’t think the trailer was bad, but I suspected that it would ruin the film for me. And it did. The film has a final twist (although I’m sure you would see it coming anyway) that is revealed in the trailer.</p>

<p>“Surely a bluff,” I thought, “They wouldn’t give away the ending before anyone had seen the film.”</p>

<p>Oh, how I was wrong.</p>

<p>I won’t tell you what is revealed in the trailer, however. If you haven’t seen it, go watch the film; you’ll enjoy it more than anyone who has. If you have seen the trailer, then go see the film anyway. Sure, you’ll know what’s going on, but it won’t stop it from being a decent film.</p>

<p>But, Big Movie Studios: Stop giving away big plot points in the trailers. We don’t want to know!</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Time is quite important to us all and something I’ve been thinking about a bit recently. Not in any really deep way, mind.</p>

<p>On Friday, my watch stopped. This, to me, is devastating. I check my watch constantly to make sure I’ve got enough time to do whatever I want to before having to go do something else (I’m watching the computer clock now to make sure I’ve got enough time to write this before going out).</p>

<p>Now being a Friday meant that I couldn’t get a new battery fitted until today (Monday). So I thought, “Hmm… wear one of your other watches”. What did I find? They’re <em>all</em> broken. I let them cut out one after another, moving onto the next without replacing the last. Stupid mistake! So, I had to endure a weekend of not knowing exactly what time it is. This bothers me.</p>

<p>Only yesterday, British Summer Time started, often shortened to <acronym title="British Summer Time">BST</acronym>. Now, that won’t mean much to most people, but losing an hour in bed means a lot to me, especially since I’ve been sleeping quite erratically recently. Why can’t we just keep getting an extra hour in bed? After 12 years of moving forward <em>twice</em> a year (instead of forward once and back once), things would end up working out.</p>

<p>Shit, why not move forward twice a month and we’d get the whole cycle sorted inside a year and get plenty of extra time in bed? Best plan of all time, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole situation has worked out: I’ve adjusted to the hour stolen from me (still looking forward to getting it back in October), and two of my watches are now working.</p>

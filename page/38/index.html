  <h3><a href="/Archives/2010/04/03/film-fight-2010-march/">Film Fight 2010: March</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The March 2010 film fight includes no fewer than 6 brand new movies. That should make up for the slightly quieter-than-usual February. Onwards…</p>

<p><strong>The Crazies</strong> looked like it had decent potential: a Romero remake about an infected township, lots of explosions and action, and a little humour alongside. It blows it. The action overwhelms the story from the very beginning, moving things on to the next set-piece before really establishing any of the characters. Without anyone we actually care about, the film suffers immensely. The plot itself is as expected, but it fails to hit any of the big scares a film like this needs. It never gets better than mediocre. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/9894174477">my The Crazies Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A lot was expected of Tim Burton’s foray into Lewis Carroll’s classic novel, but <strong>Alice In Wonderland</strong> disappoints. It’s not a filming of either Alice story but a bizarre sequel/retelling. It fails by paying too much fan-service to the world of Wonderland, attempting to squeeze every character into this semi-new narrative, rather than tell a more coherent tale. The characters themselves are the high-point, with some great (if too short) appearances by the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Does the spectacle of 3d make up for some of the story failings? No, not this time. Unlike Avatar, the effects on display are average at best. Some of the scenes work better than others, but some are clearly flat layers. There are also some frankly odd choices in the direction: tightly pulled-focus does not work in 3D. All in all, a disappointment.  (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/10122829856">my Alice In Wonderland Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Crazy Heart</strong> earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar for his performance as drunken country singer, Bad Blake; and rightly so. The performances in this film are high quality, without ever getting towards scenery-chewing territory. Both Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal put in excellent and subtle performances, saying as much with quiet looks as with their words. The solid getting-your-life-together is marred only by a weak ending, when the central character gets his life together a little too fast to feel satisfying. A little more adversity and struggle here would’ve completed this very worthwhile film a lot better. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/10427696391">my Crazy Heart Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Martin Scorsese manages to show some great form with his latest work, <strong>Shutter Island</strong>, before ruining it with a cheap ending. The story follows a US Marshall tracking down an escaped mental patient on a small island off the US mainland. The film is spiked with a Lynch-ian vibe throughout, that something sinister is happening without being clear about what is wrong. It’s beautifully shot, if a little over-the-top in places. Leonardo Dicaprio pulls in a solid performance, but he can’t cover up the poor ending. The last thirty minutes devolve into cheap, seen-it-before cliche. A great beginning, that deserved a much better conclusion. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/10465887430">my Shutter Island Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</strong> fails to live up to the not-inconsiderable hype. While some of the acting is solid, the story is full of cheap genre cliches. If you can imagine taking a high-street bestselling thriller and filming it straight-up, then you can imagine this movie: our heroes get involved in a murder investigation, working through it by uncovering previously indecipherable (but ultimately nonsense) clues. It’s slow to get started, and fails to engage. If you can switch off and not worry too much about how coherent the investigation is, then you can probably get something out of the performances. Otherwise, I’d pass on this film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/10817443727">my Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>I Love You, Phillip Morris</strong> is a real wasted opportunity, from what seems like it could be a genuinely brilliant story about a conman who will go to great lengths to get what he wants. Instead we have a movie that sits between flimsy comedy and feel-good movie, but never really reaching either. The central relationship between Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor never feels convincing or genuine, needing more time to develop than the few moments we are given. The film desperately needed a longer run-time in order to show more development. Here’s a hint: if you have more than one montage (I think there were at least 3-4), you need a longer movie. A real shame, as it would be good to see Carrey do another serious film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/10991752397">my I Love You, Phillip Morris review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner this month is <strong>Crazy Heart</strong>, mostly for the fantastic performances by the central cast and despite the short final act.</p>

    <p>It was a bit of a quiet month for me at the cinema, despite a lot of films that looked like they might be good being released. I only saw two films…</p>

<p><strong>Youth in Revolt</strong> is a Michael Cera film, which should set up a number of expectations for it. You expect it to be a cute, indie-comedy about a geeky kid who has to find confidence to get the girl, or some other variation on the theme. The first act plays straight into this and is fairly weak for it. The middle, however, is substantially better as the lead character defers to his maniac alter-ego. Sadly, even this pretty funny section is ruined somewhat by the fact that 90% of it is in the trailer. While the ending isn’t as strong, it’s a fine finish to a watchable, but not great, movie. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/8732126616">my Youth in Revolt Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>A Single Man</strong> is a fairly straight-forward and somewhat predictable story of living with grief, through the eyes of someone who cannot allow themselves to express their feelings. The direction here is solid, bringing memories of Kubrick’s shorter shots; dressing tables, desks, and lived-in spaces giving the feel of the characters in a few short seconds. Colin Firth puts in a fantastic performance as the lead, wavering between having a breakdown at any moment and keeping a stiff upper-lip. A very good film overall. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/9434205340">my A Single Man Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>While there wasn’t much in the way of competition, <strong>A Single Man</strong> is a well-deservied winner.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2010/02/02/film-fight-2010-january/">Film Fight 2010: January</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Another year, and another fresh film fight. As always, January was a tough month, with lots of pretty strong competition (usually the Oscar wannabes are released around this time of year). To get us started, there are 6 films this month.</p>

<p>First up is Robert Downey Jr. in a role that he really wasn’t born to play: <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong>. Guy Ritchie gives us an interesting take on the classic detective. His typically non-linear storytelling is used to great effect to explain how the master detective has reached his conclusions, and is particularly good when he’s sizing up opponents in fights, slowly and methodically showing how he’s going to break down their defences. Why this particular story mechanic is dropped relatively early in the film is beyond me, because it’s one of the strongest. Less good is the script: a fairly poor mishmash of ideas, ranging from secret societies, magic, steampunk and master villians. It doesn’t particularly fit into the Sherlock Holmes mythos, and doesn’t readily establish itself as a new take. It’s a pretty mediocre action film, that’s also trying to be a comedy. It fails to do anything particularly well. Not recommended.  (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7313858309">my Sherlock Holmes Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Daybreakers</strong> is a surprisingly watchable, but not great, film. It deftly manages to build up its world, quickly, quietly and effectively, and moves on with the story it has to tell. This is a world where an infection has caused the vampires to take over and hunt down the humans. The vampires, however, have over-extended and food is becoming scarce. Queue a story about diminishing food supplies, the folly of rapid and mindless expansion, and a lot of gore. That’s what saves this film: the tongue-in-cheek bloodbath we’re treated with visually, paired with some slightly cheesy lines. The film would’ve been better had it been more over-the-top. As it stands, Daybreakers is a decent action movie, but not a great one. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7493111154">my Daybreaks Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Road</strong> is the almost resolutely bleak, yet absolutely compelling. The primary narrative follows a father and son travelling through a post-apocalyptic world (what happened is never explained), as they encounter endless difficulties and enemies. What starts as trying to protect his son soon becomes a desperate paranoia, as the father becomes wary of everyone they met, and slowly loses his way. Several scenes are horrifyingly blunt about the lengths the father will go to to ensure they don’t become food for the more cannibalistic elements, and Viggo Mortensen does a fantastic job of showing the slow decay that takes a grip of him. While the ending ties things up a little too neatly, the rest of the film is very well done. A must see. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7597149764">my The Road Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Not many people would make a comedy about firing people, but Jason Reitman has done just that with <strong>Up in the Air</strong>. The core conceit gives way to an inspection of the main character’s choices in life at just the right time, showing him up to be a willing outcast and seeing if those choices are right. While it does veer dangerously close to schmaltzy in places, it always manages to pull away by being brutally honest elsewhere. It’s not the funniest comedy, nor the best character piece, but both halves combine to make a good, solid movie. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7862400594">my Up in the Air Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>A Prophet</strong> is a very interesting French film, a fairly gritty take on a prison drama. Malik begins as a young, somewhat naive hoodlum who goes to jail and, over the course of the film, becomes warped by his environment and the things he needs to do to survive. It doesn’t pull many punches as he schemes his way further up the criminal ladder. It’s well-structured and well-paced, being lent real weight by the very natural performances. While the scene in the middle where they both use the title and throw around a dead deer are puzzlingly unnecessary (and in poor taste), the rest of the film is very well done. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/8151079914">my A Prophet Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Precious</strong> is a fairly harrowing story of bullying, abusive upbringings and never thinking you can make something of yourself. While, at times, it turns things around a little too neatly, the main plot-line is equally engaging and chilling. Mo’Nique puts in an Oscar worthy performance as the abusive mother, handling a fairly dicey subject with a great believability. It’s not easy to watch, but it is worthwhile. A powerful film. (Read <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/8414638989">my Precious Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>And the winner? It was a close-run thing between Precious, The Road and A Prophet, but I think <strong>The Road</strong> takes it in the end. Another great January for film.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2009/12/31/film-fight-finale-2009/">Film Fight: Finale 2009</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>As always <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2008/12/31/film-fight-finale-2008/">my caveat from previous years still apply</a>: Film Fight is a knock-out tournament and, as such, will only select my favourite film. It makes no guarantees about any other place.</p>

<p>First, the non-finalists that deserve a nod:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slumdog Millionaire</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</li>
  <li>Anvil: The Story of Anvil</li>
  <li>Monsters Vs. Aliens</li>
  <li>Star Trek</li>
  <li>Antichrist</li>
  <li>Mesrine: Killer Instinct</li>
  <li>Zombieland</li>
  <li>Up</li>
  <li>Where The Wild Things Are</li>
</ul>

<p>And then the monthly finalists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: <strong>The Wrestler</strong></li>
  <li>February: <strong>Revolutionary Road</strong></li>
  <li>March: <strong>Bronson</strong></li>
  <li>April: <strong>In The Loop</strong></li>
  <li>May: <strong>Synecdoche, New York</strong></li>
  <li>June: <strong>The Hangover</strong></li>
  <li>July: <strong>Moon</strong></li>
  <li>August: <strong>Inglourious Basterds</strong></li>
  <li>September: <strong>District 9</strong></li>
  <li>October: <strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox</strong></li>
  <li>November: <strong>A Serious Man</strong></li>
  <li>December: <strong>Nowhere Boy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, it was very easy to give the title to There Will Be Blood (despite a good effort from No Country For Old Men), but this year the finalists are almost all fantastic films; The Hangover being the only one that slid through in a weak month.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I could pick a bronze medallist this year, the pack is so tight, but the silver (almost gold) goes to Darren Aronofsky’s fantastic movie, The Wrestler. It’s dark, and gritty, and will leave you a little sadder, but only because it’s such an excellent movie. An absolute must-see.</p>

<p>The winner, however, is <strong>Synecdoche, New York</strong>. Charlie Kaufmann’s film is so rich with imagery, imagination and an incredible spectrum of emotions that it can’t help but be an amazing film, in the truest sense of that word. It’s an instant classic, in my book.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>The last month of the year, and the final five films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Men Who Stare At Goats</strong> tries to be an oddball tale about the forming of an army unit who are training in psychic warfare. Despite a fairly big name cast (George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, and Ewan Macgregor), it never really manages to capitalise on what it has. It’s funny in places, but largely inconsistent. It’s merely an okay film. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/6365885341">my Men Who Stare At Goats Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Spike Jonze is well-known for his vivid imagination, so there’s probably no-one better placed to turn <strong>Where The Wild Things Are</strong> into a movie. Rather than do a direct adaptation, which would be incredibly short, Jonze has focussed on telling a story about the problems people often face in childhood. It’s very cute and sweet in many places, with a tiny hint of menace streaked through a large portion. He expertly moves the protagonist, Max, through his journey, showing us a wide-range of beautiful moments and difficult challenges. The lead, Max Records, does an excellent job. Good entertainment.  (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/6632635892">my Where The Wild Things Are Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Doing a biopic of John Lennon’s life you might focus on his success and admiration as a fascinating musician. <strong>Nowhere Boy</strong> instead focusses on his formative teenage years to great effect. Seeing the legendary figure as a troubled teen was a good choice for a screen play, and it’s handled very well. Given his abandonment as a child, and his subsequent reconnection with his mother a decade or so later, we get to see a fairly turbulent time in his life that seems to have shaped him. The film has several very powerful scenes, and manages to draw a fairly detailed picture of Lennon’s early years. Very good.   (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7134591697">my Nowhere Boy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Avatar</strong> is the film that has been in the making for a dozen years according to director, James Cameron. Sadly, very few of those years have been spent on the story, which is somewhat flimsy and you have seen before. The character development is relatively meek, and most of the film lacks any real depth. It does have a message which, while delivered a little heavy-handedly, is worthwhile: both that we should be conserving the world’s culture and the environment in which we live. Avatar is, however, a good, mindless, action film. The effects (in 3D) are well-done, and some of the battle sequences are suitably epic and fun. If you want something fun that you don’t have to think about, this is your movie. It’s entertaining, but ultimately nothing special. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7134679491">my Avatar Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Humpday</strong> is about two friends, an artist and an apparently average Joe, who decide to make an art film of themselves having sex, for various reasons. It’s shot in a natural, almost documentary style; managing to be simultaneously amusing and uncomfortable as they get closer to the filming. The tension throughout is well-pitched, particularly between the “average” guy and his wife. Some great performances make this film, even if the ending is a little abrupt. (See <a href="http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/7212513921">my Humpday Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner this month is <strong>Nowhere Boy</strong> for an emotional and affecting biopic that perfectly captures an important time in a young man’s life.</p>

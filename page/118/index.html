    <p>Currently burning a lot of time in this part of the world (specifically, computing labs) is the psychedelic game <a href="http://www.mausland.de/dolphin.swf">Dolphins</a>.</p>

<p>Possibly the most insane, challenging and fun game to pass these shores in months.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>After having received the first piece of Comment Spam, I started thinking about the various strategies I could put in place to fight it should things get worse. Bayesian filters, compulsory previewing, proxied links (to make the act pointless), throttling, allowing previously visited IPs only, putting the comments system into the brain of a monkey and using pavlovian techniques to train it to fight spam…</p>

<p>… Then it occured to me. The number one, must-have feature of any comment spam filtering system is: the ability to <em>delete spam</em>.</p>

<p>Although the delete function has been done since the comments system was created, it was never wired up to the admin interface – leaving me with undeletable spam. Doh!</p>

<p>It is, of course, hooked up now.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/01/26/BringingAdsToRSS/">Bringing Ads To RSS</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Advertising is everywhere. TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, clothing and the web. We have gotten to be relatively good at tuning these things out.</p>

<p>At each step along the way, the advertisers need to try and improve (read: get more annoying and intrusive) to keep enough people watching to make money. All sorts of stupid ideas have been tried (the Mortal Kombat blood-squirting posters, anyone?).</p>

<p>They’ve got a new idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rssads.com/"><acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> Ads</a> is going to provide a way for advertisers to put their ads in RSS feeds. Sign up for it and you could make money from click through or per view advertising.</p>

<p>In principle, this is a nice idea to let people make a little money from their sites. I’m all in favour of that. But, and you knew there was always a but coming, it simply won’t work.</p>

<p>Some people will immediately black list any sites containing the adverts. Others will come up with clever filters to get rid of the majority of the adverts and get back to normal browsing. The rest of us will simply use these filters and hope for the best.</p>

<p>The outcome of ignoring the adverts is the same as everywhere else. The market plummets, the advertisters get more desperate, and a new round of annoyance begins. Ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Maybe this is just pessimism, but web users don’t like adverts and are becoming more and more savvy to ignoring them every day. It won’t work.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2004/01/25/7PoorFeaturesOfRSS/">7 Poor Features Of RSS</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p><a href="http://www.dylangreene.com/">Dylan Greene</a> is discussing the <a href="http://www.dylangreene.com/blog.asp?blogID=364">7 must-have features of <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym></a>. I disagree with most.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> – RSS uses http authentication, if you want it. If you don’t need it (as in most cases), it is bloat.</li>
  <li><strong>Query Standard</strong> – Outside of the scope of a simple syndication standard, and certainly not a “must have” for mainstram use.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Standards</strong> – I agree on this.</li>
  <li><strong>The Name</strong> – The name is fine. Call it the more generic “syndication” is you must.</li>
  <li><strong>Ad Standard</strong> – Hardly a must have and a bit of a pipe dream. Ads will never be standardised, because that makes them easy to filter.</li>
  <li><strong>DRM and encryption</strong> – Avoid proprietary cludges? Not going to happen. The corporations will put in whatever they like, regardless.</li>
  <li><strong>Attachment Standard</strong> – It already exists but is never used.</li>
</ol>

<p>I doubt very much whether the average web browser cares about any of those things, or what effect they will have.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>A new toy for you all: <a href="/Code/ActoRss">ActoRss</a>. It generates <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds for any actor available on <a href="http://us.imdb.com">IMDb</a>.</p>

<p>The idea for this came when I recently wondered what Steve Buscemi was working on. Rather than going and finding out, I’d prefer to be told. And along came ActoRss.</p>

<p>If you want to make <del>stalking</del> <ins>following</ins> Liv Tyler easier, just go to the spangly new <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/ActoRss/?Name=Liv+Tyler">Liv Tyler RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

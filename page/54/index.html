  <h3><a href="/Archives/2007/08/21/film-fight-june-2007/">Film Fight: June 2007</a></h1>
  <p class="author">

  <div class="post">
    <p>June was a bigger month than May for cinema, with 6 films taken in. Let’s get started.</p>

<p><strong>The Hitcher</strong> is a remake of the classic Rutger Hauer film about a couple who don’t pick up a hitch-hiker they almost run into. The hiker, the bad guy, then ruthlessly chases across state, murdering anyone who gets in the way. Sadly, it lacks the excellent directorial work of it’s namesake, becoming more of a modern (and by that I mean “dumb”) horror film rather than a taut psychological thriller (with more than enough action). Sean Bean also continues his recent run of terrible performances. Though I can’t really recommend The Hitcher, there is at least one scene that is really quite something to see.</p>

<p>I once said that the big <a href="/Archives/2005/03/01/FilmFightFebruary2005/">failure of Ocean’s Twelve</a> was that it didn’t really show the heists being perpetrated by the main characters: <strong>Ocean’s Thirteen</strong> makes me take that back. This time they painstakingly go over every tedious detail of the large scam, spreading some sections way beyond breaking point. Again, this is basically watching an A-list cast mess around on holiday, with a overwritten dialogue and underwritten plot. If you liked the second film, you’ll probably like this.</p>

<p>French thriller <strong>Tell No One</strong> is about a man whose wife is killed after they have an argument and, seven years later, he spots her on CCTV. From there the investigation reopens, placing him as a suspect, as he tries to understand what’s happening. The director captures every aspect of the story perfectly, from the bitter anger to the overwhelming passions. Beautifully shot and performed, and only marred by a few extraneous scenes and characters, this film is one of the best of the year.</p>

<p>One of the few Asian action films to make it through this year, <strong>Exiled</strong> is a fairly silly example of the gun play and gangsters genre. Normally the story is just an excuse for some ludicrous action scenes, but here there are nowhere near enough worthwhile action scenes to keep things moving forward. It suffers sorely by tring to be more stylish than it is. A regrettably poor entry.</p>

<p>Owen Wilson tries his hand at the fright game in <strong>Vacancy</strong>. This is a modern horror film done well, balancing the brutal and gruesome with intense emotional moments and impossible but necessary decisions. The set-up is unsurprising, but the pay offs are of a high enough calibre that it does not matter. Vacancy won’t win any awards, but it’s a fine example of the genre.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Captivity</strong> is pretty much the opposite in terms of the quality of horror it offers. More of an excuse for a bunch of pre-canned set-ups than an attempt to do something that makes sense as a whole, this film fails on a number of levels, not least of all a number of weak performances and a nonsensical plot. If you liked Saw, you might like this (similar style). If not, avoid.</p>

<p>The winner this month was the excellent <strong>Tell No One</strong>, proving itself to be great in almost every suit.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2007/08/18/film-fight-may-2007/">Film Fight: May 2007</a></h1>

    <p>One of the reasons the film fight series has been a little delayed this year is that I was a little less obsessive about my record keeping than normal. One consequence of this is that I only seem to have seen one film in May. This could be true (I was travelling a lot) or possibly not. Either way…</p>

<p><strong>Magicians</strong> is what happens when two of Britain’s best comedians, David Mitchell and Robert Webb, get watered down to fit a mainstream audience. While this could’ve been another great and fairly dark piece of comedy, like Peep Show at its sickest, it’s barely more than a children’s film with some blue references. Forgettable, and uninteresting. Avoid.</p>

<p><del datetime="2007-08-18T23:10:26+00:00">Sadly, despite the review, <strong>Magicians</strong> wins for May… unless I can remember what else I saw.</del></p>

<p><ins datetime="2007-08-18T23:10:26+00:00">Update: I found the other two ticket stubs for May!</ins></p>

<p><strong>28 Weeks Later</strong> is that rarest of things: a sequel that pays adequate respect to the original material, while standing on its own feet. The opening sequence is both stunning and shocking, the excellent score making it one of the most intense openers I’ve seen in a long time. As zombie films go, 28 Weeks Later is ok. It isn’t trying to make a point, but has a reasonable vision of how the world would go wrong. There are some fairly trite missteps, such as the main character zombie (a device used effectively by George Romero in his series of zombie films, but abused here). Overall, this is still fairly enjoyable.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Zodiac</strong> is David Fincher’s latest master work: an account of the Zodiac murders, largely from the perspective of the cartoonist who became so obsessed with the story that he wrote one of the definitive books on the matter. As the case was unsolved, Fincher focusses on the paranoia and fear found in this time and place, while expanding on the details. Every scene is beautifully shot, with CGI used seamlessly (as it should be), and excellent performances from the whole cast. Although it doesn’t quite match some of his previous work (Fight Club, Seven), it’s still a fantastic piece of cinema.</p>

<p>With that, Magicians is no longer the winner for May, <strong>Zodiac</strong> wins.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2007/08/16/film-fight-april-2007/">Film Fight: April 2007</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>April was a big month for cinema, but something of a mixed selection.</p>

<p>First, <strong>300</strong> is the film version of the classic Frank Miller comic book. Though I expect most people saw this film, I thought it was fairly bad. The acting ranged from fairly strong in some places to camp, ludicrous and over-the-top throughout most of the film. While much has been made of the epic scale of the battles, it’s hard to be impressed by men clearly fighting in front of blue screens. I don’t know why Hollywood thinks they’re at a level where they can do pure CG convincingly, but the evidence is clearly against them. Everything looks cheap and empty, but on a larger scale than we might have otherwise seen. The story itself is strong (which is why it has survived this long) but the director has not done it justice here. A real shame.</p>

<p><strong>I Want Candy</strong> is your typical Brit-comedy: cheap, a little tacky, but fun enough to watch. It’s the story of two struggling film students who, through some convoluted twists, end up making a porno with heart. It has all the usual boy-meets-girl storytelling you’d expect from the genre, but that’s not really a great criticism. Again, as light comedy goes, you can do much worse.</p>

<p>Far more serious is Danny Boyle’s <strong>Sunshine</strong>. The set-up is fairly obvious sci-fi boilerplate, but the plot is a little wider in scope: the exploration into the unknown, realising you’re a very small piece of a mind-bendingly large universe, and the effects of extremes on the human psyche. While much of this is brilliantly shot and scored, it stumbles in the final act. Writer Alex Garland uses his usual trick of establishing a more manageable crisis and resolving it as a finale, which generally works well. Instead, in this instance, the final third of the film falls in the science fiction trappings that have been so carefully avoided to this point and goes wayward. A real shame.</p>

<p>More comedy can be found in <strong>Blades of Glory</strong>, about two rival figure skaters who join forces to beat their evil rivals. The plot follows the standard buddy comedy pattern: they hate each other, they agree to work together, it doesn’t work out well at first, they each learn something from the other, a last minute fumble looks set to destroy it all, but finally they win through. Though it isn’t Will Ferrell at his comic-best, it still stands up as a decent film.</p>

<p><strong>The Lives of Others</strong> deservedly won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film this year, the reasons shining through in every scene. Focussed on the activities of the Stasi and their invasive and bureaucratic processes, the film shows both sides of the ex-government activities. The main characters are a writer, who gradually rails further and further against the corrupt state, and the Stasi agent sent to monitor his every move. It builds a great tale of frustration and emotional impotence, in the face of a state destroying itself through its own policies and paranoia.</p>

<p><strong>Half Nelson</strong> is about the coming together of an addict teacher and a young girl in his class who discovers him nearly passed out. The core of the film is about them coming together despite, or perhaps because of, their differences and trying to better themselves. It’s a fairly formulaic premise, updated a little, but fails in it’s execution: our teacher shows very little in the way of redeeming or interesting traits, his spiral downward being of his own making. It’s hard to sympathise with a character who is given numerous chances to change but doesn’t. Perhaps that’s the point but, honestly, I didn’t care by the end. There was not enough tension or struggle to warrant the time spent here.</p>

<p>Finally, mind-numbing action in the form of <strong>Shooter</strong>: a completely by-the-numbers political action-thriller. Mark Wahlberg gets caught up in a plot to assassinate the president for no good reason, but consistently evades capture while uncovering the conspiracy. Some terrible performances (excluding the competent lead) and obvious plot holes mark this remarkably bad film as one to avoid.</p>

<p>The winner? Easily, <strong>The Lives of Others</strong>: an easy contender for film of the year, even at this early stage.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2007/08/14/film-fight-march-2007/">Film Fight: March 2007</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Yes, I let film fight go for a number of months without update. I’m starting it again now, with the March update and should be back up-to-date by the time this month ends.</p>

<p>First up is <strong>A Guide to Recognising Your Saints</strong>, an autobiographical tale of a boy trying to escape the insular world in which he inhabits and become more than his parents. The story largely focuses on the hardships and maniac friends the protagonist keeps during childhood, and flips between showing his past and him occasionally revisiting it as a grown-up. Although there are some powerful, emotionally charged scenes between the lead and his father, the film itself is fairly hollow. It’s a standard coming-of-age story, which is a little too self indulgent.</p>

<p>Comedy: <strong>School for Scoundrels</strong> is a remake of the classic film, about a guy who goes to classes to learn how to be a bit better with the ladies. Billy Bob Thornton is perfectly cast as the devious, double-crossing teacher; doling out advice and stealing girls from the star performers. A fairly silly and lightweight film that won’t win any awards, but does entertain.</p>

<p>With <strong>The Prestige</strong> setting a fairly high bar in the magic and revenge themes only a few months ago, <strong>The Illusionist</strong> had a lot to live up to: it failed miserably. Using fairly weak CGI rather than stage magic is one mistake that can be forgiven if the plot is adequate but, sadly, it isn’t. It’s predictable, lazy, and lacks any real impact; certainly a weaker moment in Ed Norton’s career.</p>

<p>Finally, Matt Damon stars as a CIA spy back in the founding era of the agency in <strong>The Good Shepherd</strong>. Rather than focus on action, as is the vogue, it explores the cost of his dedication on his family life and the lengths to which he will go to protect them, despite an increasing distance between them. Ultimately, we know he put himself in this position, but we can’t help but feel sorry for Damon’s character as his life slips away. Beautifully shot, and with an air of authority, any shortcomings in pace are made up for in craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Though it may have struggled in a stronger month, <strong>The Good Shepherd</strong> is the only real candidate for March’s winner.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2007/07/22/prison-thriller/">Prison Thriller</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I’m not usually one to recycle content created by other people, but this is too good to pass up. Imagine, if you will, 1500 prisoners. Now imagine the video for “Thriller”, by Michael Jackson. Now imagine <a href="http://www.justpressplay.net/music/michael-jackson/news/1500-inmates-practice-thriller-dance.html">1500 prisoners recreating the video for “Thriller”</a>.</p>

<p>If you didn’t follow that link, stop what you’re doing, have a look and then come back.</p>

<p>Done? Excellent. How astounding it is aside, it really does raise some questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Did things like this happen before YouTube?</li>
  <li>How the hell did they convince 1500 prisoners that this was worth doing?</li>
  <li>Of all the things you could do with 1500 willing people, was this maybe a bit of a waste of time?</li>
</ol>

<p>Think hard about number 1 for a second: I’m really genuinely curious as to how much outlandish stuff happens and gets filmed now that wouldn’t have before YouTube existed. I’m sure it happened sometimes (You’ve Been Framed does not count), but I can only imagine the volume has increased a stupendous amount.</p>

<p>So, the real question: if YouTube is powerful enough to cause the world to warp in this bizarre way, what else is it capable of?</p>

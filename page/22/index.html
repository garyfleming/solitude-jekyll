    <p>For November, there are four films in the fight…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Nocturnal Animals</strong> sees Tom Ford follow up his 2009 debut, A Single Man, with something more stylish and moody. A story within a story, the film is sometimes beautiful and sometimes sickeningly ugly, terrifyingly gripping and rigidly dull. The performances are world class, with Jake Gyllenhall standing out in his dual role. Very worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/795282920332201984">my Nocturnal Animals Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Environmental documentaries have a tendency to be po-faced, but <strong>Before The Flood</strong> manages to bring both insight and charm to such an important subject. Leonardo DiCaprio leads us around the world, showing how current global systems are destroying key environmental elements that will inevitably lead to a collapse. Stark, clear, and succinct, this film delivers its message well. Watch. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/795283243314585600">my Before The Flood Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The second Amy Adams performance of the month, <strong>Arrival</strong>, sees her as a linguist asked to decipher an alien language following a group of ships arriving on Earth. Beautifully shot and structured, as the layers of story peel back we realise more about what we’ve already seen than what is to come. There are some tricks here, for sure, but it’s so magnificently managed that we buy into the unfolding bittersweet heartache. From the acting right down to the sound design, this is one of the best films of the year. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/797786831312064512">my Arrival Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Accountant</strong> sees an exceptional cast play out a fairly dumb premise. Ben Affleck plays an Accountant by day and assassin by night, none of which quite makes sense. It’s predictable, and silly, with some decent action. JK Simmons, Jon Bernthal and Anna Kendrick make things work better than they might have, but you’re going to have to suspend disbelief for a sizeable period of the run time. Fine. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/798261145081708544">my The Accountant Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>Arrival</strong> for it’s gripping beauty, and unravelling narrative.</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>A big October again, with six films in the fight…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>The Magnificent Seven</strong> is a remake of a remake that didn’t need to be remade the first time. The plot is a little tired but is serviced by a generally great cast; Peter Sarsgaard is particularly notable as the villian, but Chris Pratt appears to be in a different movie from everyone else. The action sequences are so-so, with a slow and dull pace throughout. An almost entirely forgettable film. Skip. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/782253971524218880">my Magnificent Seven Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Swiss Army Man</strong> is a very strange film. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s weirder than that. Paul Dano’s character goes on an adventure with a corpse who may or may not be speaking to him. It’s never particularly clear where the film is headed, or the intent, leaving it feeling unfocussed, yet still somehow enjoyable. It’s slow, weird, and fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/783212527270453248">my Swiss Army Man Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>John Michael McDonagh follows up the dark humour of The Guard and Calvary with corrupt cop comedy, <strong>War On Everyone</strong>. Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Pena are excellent as the leads, fitting into a world that feels like a Shane Black movie but with the darker comedy we expect from McDonagh. The whole thing is well-shot, well-paced, and well-written. The main villian’s plan starts to feel a little contrived, but just go along for the ride. Fun. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/785557622137163776">my War On Everyone Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Mascots</strong> feels remarkably similar to previous Christopher Guest film, Best In Show. Whether that’s a problem depends entirely one whether or not you like his movies. While some of the eccentricity of the characters is a little forced, the mockumentary works reasonably well. There are some good laughs, a decent cast, and a genuinely heartfelt story at its core. Definitely worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/788810688785416192">my Mascots Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Louis Theroux, having tackled other religious fringe groups, turns his attention to Scientology in <strong>My Scientology Movie</strong>. It’s an odd documentary, revealing little that is new about the group. However, it’s worth watching for the way that he recreates stories about current Scientology leader, David Miscavige. The actor playing the dramatised Miscavige is genuinely frightening, embodying the stories perfectly. A little flat in places, but watchable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/790121098994155520">my My Scientology Movie Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, Doctor Strange is the latest entry in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe, taking it into some of the mystical places the lead inhabits. As an origin story, it feels fairly rushed and lacks any kind of originality. Strangely, Benedict Cumberbatch comes across as fairly dull, which I can only assume is due to the writing. Others laughed throughout, but the humour didn’t hit for me either. That said, the final action sequence is genuinely inspired: one of the best, smartest sections of a Marvel film in a long time. Not amazing.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/793195553245069312">my Doctor Strange Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for October is <strong>War On Everyone</strong>, for its catchy visuals, witty dialogue, and fun action.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2016/12/film-fight-2016-september/">Film Fight 2016: September</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>September was a decent month with five films that are all at least decent.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Bad Moms</strong> is a comedy about a mother who decides to act reasonably(ish) rather than live up to the expectations which society (and the PTA, in particular) have for her. It’s got some very funny moments, a mixture of great and fairly bland characters, and fun (if uneven) plotting. It’s good, but not great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/775413654284079104">my Bad Moms Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Infiltrator</strong> sees Bryan Cranston as a US Customs agent trying to infiltrate the Columbian drug cartels. As you’d expect, Cranston absolutely nails his part. One scene, where he is forced to berate an unknowing waiter, is as gripping as it is humiliating. Beyond that, it’s fairly disjointed: moving around the plot and tone a little too incoherently. It’s not bad, just not fully formed. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/777473114007568384">my The Infiltrator Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>I have a soft-spot for movies about time-loops, and <strong>Arq</strong> is no exception. A strange machine keeps resetting a few hours of a young man’s life just as a home invasion begins. Set in a near-future dystopia, we see a great conflict played out again and again in an odd cat and mouse game. I won’t spoil any of the twists, but it seems to do something different from most in the genre. Worth watching. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/777473369633619968">my Arq Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>The Girl With All The Gifts</strong> is a new take on zombie movies that works remarkably well. A young girl is being held by the military for reasons unknown, as they try to keep their encampment clear. As we learn why and the plot moves forward, we see a strange new world from the young protagonist’s point of view. Brutal violence is balanced by darkly funny moments, and sympathetic characters on all sides. Well-shot, and with an excellent score. Great.(See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/780502414696808448">my The Girl With All The Gifts Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Sausage Party</strong> is a Seth Rogen comedy (animated, this time) with all that entails. If you dislike his other work, you won’t like this. For the rest of us, this film is very dumb and extremely slow to start. It never manages to land any of the big laughs it wants, but is passably funny. Probably one to have a few drinks before seeing. Okay. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/781534641522114562">my Sausage Party Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>A tougher month than most, but the winner is <strong>The Girl With All The Gifts</strong>: dark, well-written, and refreshingly original.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2016/12/film-fight-2016-august/">Film Fight 2016: August</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>August was an average month, with four films to review.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Jason Bourne</strong> is the 5th film in the Bourne franchise, having coaxed Matt Damon back into the lead role after the terrible Jeremy Renner (as Aaron Cross) entry. It’s not a return to form, but a lot of boxes get checked: shaky cam action, improvised plans, and overblown plotting. The dialogue is noticeably spare, with Damon saying very little, but enough is conveyed by others to get the point. Vincent Cassel is also strong as this entry’s bad guy. Watchable, but far from essential.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/762247038763433984">my Jason Bourne Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Beloved Roald Dahl book, <strong>The BFG</strong>, is once again being turned into a motion picture, directed this time by Steven Spielberg. Mark Rylance puts in a great lead performance as the titular giant, nailing his odd dialect and mannerisms perfectly. Not much else works. The story is a bit flat and boring, with a good twenty minutes of runtime that could be excised, and visuals that are sub-par. Avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/764396889676603392">my The BFG Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Next up sees Warner Bros. continue to squander the DC license with <strong>Suicide Squad</strong>. On paper this should’ve been great: send a well-cast group of baddies on a dangerous mission, with witty banter and threat from both sides. What we get is a solid performance from Will Smith and Margo Robbie, and… that’s it. The story telling is an expositional mess, the stylization is incoherent, and the characters lack any sort of motivation. Generic antagonists make up most of the fight scenes against the squad, who mostly dispatch them with guns rather than any kind of interesting ability. Visually terrible, badly edited, and a turd of a plot. Do not go near this. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/765950794805936129">my Suicide Squad Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>War Dogs</strong> is the story of two young opportunists who inexplicably become arms dealers. The story beats are cliched, but could’ve been enjoyable had they not been told via tell-don’t-show narration. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are okay as the leads, but the secondary performances are poor. Not worth it. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/771025036274786304">my War Dogs Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner for August is <strong>Jason Bourne</strong>, an okay film that would’ve struggled in most other months.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <p>Four films this month in the fight…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Born to be Blue</strong> is a moving look at being a life-long addict, when opportunity to break from your recovery presents itself constantly. Ethan Hawke is excellent as Chet Baker, in this biographical look at the jazz musician’s struggles. He disappears into the role more than in any other that I can recall. Sad, beautiful, and striking, this is a must-see movie. Great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/756528795939643393">my Born to be Blue Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Star Trek: Beyond</strong> is an odd but engaging entry in the new Trek canon. It feels more like a double episode of the show than a big budget blockbuster, but is all the better for it. It feels tight and coherent, rather than full of empty spectacle. The characters are fun without being stupid. While it never astounds, it doesn’t really disappoint either. A resoundingly decent movie. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/757221265459515394">my Star Trek Beyond Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Rebirth</strong> is a dark satire with a dose of paranoid horror, that shades a little light on the self-help movement. While it’s certainly not a masterpiece, Fran Kranz engages as the hapless lead. It never drags or outstays its welcome, and has something to say, even if it’s not yelling. A decent watch. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/757222587600601089">my Rebirth Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Ghostbusters</strong> is an odd reboot: it wants to be separate from the franchise’s past but takes every opportunity it can to make big pointed references to things it’d be better served forgetting, falling flat on each cameo. Kate McKinnon is excellent as Holtzmann, lighting up the screen every time she appears, and Leslie Jones does well with the material she gets, but McCarthy and Wiig seem fairly rote. An unnecessary film, but entertaining enough. Worth seeing once. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/759703621810302977">my Ghostbusters Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>Born To Be Blue</strong> for Hawke’s absolutely top notch performance, in a touching movie.</p>

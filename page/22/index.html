    <p>Again, a few months late, but August’s Film Fight has 4 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong> represents a change of pace for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Where the earlier films are straight-faced without being dour, Guardians is out-and-out comic book crazy as we see the wider cosmic parts of the universe. The cast are great, managing to pull off fun action with genuinely funny moments; playing the right level of knowing insight into the absurdity of, for example, a tree that is best friends with a psychotic raccoon. The storytelling is a little exposition-heavy at times, but you won’t mind when everything else works so well. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/498511871331536896">my Guardians of the Galaxy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Inbetweeners 2</strong> is the result of extending a series way beyond breaking point. Where the series was funny, and the first film was okay, there’s barely anything left for a second film. There are a handful of horrible but funny moments, but most of the film is just the same reheated filler. Avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/501475567699767299">my The Inbetweeners 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Expendables 3</strong> is another sequel that should never have been made. As is par for the course, the opening and closing action sequences are big, extravagant indulgences that can be greatly entertaining. The problem is everything else: the awful acting, the terrible dialogue, bad pacing, pointless subplots etc. There’s very little to like when something isn’t exploding on screen. Also avoid. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/501475946940346368">my The Expendables 3 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Rover</strong> is an exceptional, cold-blooded revenge thriller against the backdrop of a society that no longer has meaningful consequences. Set in a post apocalyptic world, reminiscent of The Road, Guy Pearce delivers one of his best performances as the not-quite-right lead. Brutal, relentless and breathtaking. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/505086998856884224">my The Rover Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner is <strong>The Rover</strong> for being such a cold but gripping film.</p>

    <p>Yup, they’re getting later and later at the moment, but here’s the Film Fight for July, with 4 films…</p>

<p>First up, <strong>How To Train Your Dragon 2</strong> is a fun-enough sequel to what was a pretty good kids movie. It’s not a masterpiece, feeling a little formulaic at times, but it really didn’t have to be a classic. There are sad moments, fun moments, exciting moments. It does its job of being an entertaining, if light-hearted, film. Enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/487890508900212736">my How To Train Your Dragon 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Boyhood</strong> is a fascinating experiment: director Richard Linklater assembled his cast every year for a few weeks, ostensibly so we can see the 7-year old boy at the centre of the film turn into a 19-year old man. While the pacing doesn’t always work, it’s great to see the actors improve year-on-year. While Ellar Coltrane, as the lead, sees the most obvious evolution, it’s great to see now-seasoned actors, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, going from serviceable at the start to great towards the end. Very worthwhile. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/488304043136389121">my Boyhood Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a surprisingly good reboot of the franchise, so it was going to be interesting to see where its sequel, <strong>Dawn of the Planet of The Apes</strong>, went next. There’s a significant time jump and the human population is all but wiped out as the film begins. A small group stumble into Caesar (the ape leader) and his new family, causing tensions to rise. While the supporting cast are sketched in overly broad strokes, the leads are well-drawn characters forced into worsening situations. There are a number of missteps (the music is overwrought, the apes using guns is never earned) but it remains entertaining. A solid action/adventure. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/492027135683751936">my Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>The Purge: Anarchy</strong> takes the silly premise of The Purge (that for one night a year no crime is illegal) into a new direction. Where the original was a home-invasion horror, Anarchy is more of a suspense-thriller, in the mould of Judgement Night. Viewed through that almost B-movie lens, it’s an entertaining film. There aren’t many surprises, but the action keeps the pace up nicely. Good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/494889666706165760">my The Purge: Anarchy Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>For July, the winner is <strong>Boyhood</strong>, for being such an interesting cinematic undertaking.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2014/10/19/film-fight-2014-june/">Film Fight 2014: June</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>

  <div class="post">
    <p>It’s October, so clearly this Film Fight for June is very, very late. It is, however, quite full, with 6 films reviewed.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>A Million Ways To Die In The West</strong> is an absolutely terrible comedy. While it certainly does have some funny moments, most of which don’t rise above toilet humour, the film as a whole is almost as bad as Seth Macfarlane’s performance. He comes across as wooden when delivering anything that isn’t a gag. His knowing insights into the genre he’s pastiching get old quickly, and there’s little else going on. Boring, poorly paced, and badly acted. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/474285268921757696">my A Million Ways To Die In The West Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong> (or Live Die Repeat, or All You Need is Kill, depending on your context) is an excellent take on the time loop genre. An unwilling PR mans gets pressed into combat against an unstoppable alien force, being forced to live through his bad day thousands of time, as he slowly becomes a weapon. It does a remarkable job of compressing the wealth of information it has to convey into a clear shorthand; you’re rarely at a loss as to where he is in the cycle, even in the midst of the fast-paced action. Exciting and well made, an excellent watch. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/474285657553391616">my Edge of Tomorrow Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Fruitvale Station</strong> is the 2013 Sundance Grand Jury prize winning film, based on the true story of a man who was shot by police at the titular station. It is shot in a straightforward manner, following him around for the day leading up to the events; giving us a chance to see the struggles of the man before seeing his last struggle. The performances, like the camera work, are grounded leading to a horrible unease as the ending gets closer. Great film, well worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/476467236904124417">my Fruitvale Station Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>There have been many hours of media activity around the West Memphis 3, so it’s not surprising to see a dramatised version in the form of <strong>Devil’s Knot</strong>. It is, however, surprising to see an otherwise decent pair of leads (Reece Witherspoon and Colin Firth) turn in such poor performances. With the exception of Kevin Durand’s small role, where he absolutely nails it as John Mark Byers, there’s nothing worth seeing here. It’s poorly paced, with overwrought music, and a lack of care. If you want to know about this case, watch the Paradise Lost documentaries. Avoid this. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/481202824613998592">my Devil’s Knot Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>When 21 Jump Street was announced, it seemed like a bizarre, completely unnecessary and likely very bad movie reboot of a once popular TV show, in the vein of Bewitched. It turned out to be one of the funniest dumb comedies out of the US in a good while. <strong>22 Jump Street</strong> then is that most unnecessary of things: a sequel to an unnecessary success. Thankfully, it turns out to also be pretty good. While it never hits the highs of its predecessor, it does turn in some great scenes. It is highly derivative but knowingly so, without being a simple cash-grab. Worth seeing. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/481203444892860416">my 22 Jump Street Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Cold in July</strong> is… well, barely memorable. I am writing this significantly further on from seeing the film that I would like, but nothing much really stands out. The film is something of a throwback to the 80s revenge thrillers that have seen a small resurgence of late. It’s quite bloody in places and with relatively good performances, but the over-the-top lighting and bad pacing put this into B-movie territory. Decent. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/483723239227940864">my Cold in July Twitter review</a>)</p>

<p>The winner this month is a tough choice. As an example of the action genre, Edge of Tomorrow is very strong, but I think it’s edged out by the slightly more worthy <strong>Fruitvale Station</strong>. (As an aside, Fruitvale Station is currently on Netflix if you happen to be in Canada).</p>

    <p>May was a reasonable month with five films for Film Fight.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Blue Ruin</strong> is a strange revenge thriller, where a man seeks vengeance for the murder of his parents. The story and twists are doled out in a careful manner, with just enough exposition to keep things moving. It’s shot through with a dark humour arising from the fact that, while the protagonist is reasonably determined, he’s quite far out of his depth. Beautifully shot, and often brutal, Blue Ruin manages to juggle a number of balls effectively. Very good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/463774746031951872">my Blue Ruin Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Bad Neighbours</strong> is a Seth Rogen comedy about maturing, told from the competing perspectives of new parents and their new fraternity neighbours. The arc of the story is much as you’d expect, and many of the gags could be used in just about any similarly styled comedy. That said, it’s an entertaining enough couple of hours, with a pace that keeps things moving along. It’s hard to get excited about the film, or to pan it. Good, not great. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/463775293421809664">my Bad Neighbours Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an odd indie film with a weird sense of humour, <strong>Frank</strong> fits the bill. It’s based very loosely on the time writer Jon Ronson spent in the company of Frank Sidebottom, but allowed to slip quite far from reality. It’s full of oddball characters and awkward interactions, with a great cast (particularly Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal) making the often on-the-nose writing work. Quirky and enjoyable. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/465606345606328320">my Frank Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Another <strong>Godzilla</strong> reboot can surely only be better than the last. Well, yes, it is, but it’s still really quite poor. It opens well, with some big action coupled with some emotional beats, but quickly slides into awfulness. There are some great action set pieces throughout, but this is the dumbest movie I’ve seen in a long time. I don’t just mean that it’s a shallow action movie. No, it’s utterly moronic. The dialogue is dumb, the plotting makes little sense, and the contrivances that hold it together are, at times, painful. It doesn’t come close to recent genre entries, like Cloverfield or Pacific Rim. Very bad. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/470963047750963200">my Godzilla Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>X-Men: Days of Future Past</strong> does something that none of the other movies in the series have managed: showing a complex, cohesive and, fundamentally, comic-book plot in a fun an exciting way, whilst great actors put on a hell of a performance. Fassbender and McAvoy get to pit their characters, each with increasing depth, against each other whilst a giant, time-hopping plot plays out behind them. The action sequences are fun, the gags work well, and there’s little to let this down. A great superhero movie.  (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/472812429752418306">my X-Men: Days of Future Past Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>There were a number of good options this month, but I think the winner has to be <strong>Blue Ruin</strong>. Dark, brutal, but with just enough of a funny edge to make it less bleak. Great.</p>

  <h3><a href="/Archives/2014/07/01/film-fight-2014-april/">Film Fight 2014: April</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date"> </span>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>April was a relatively quiet month for cinema, with only three films viewed.</p>

<p>First up, <strong>Noah</strong> is a heavily dramatised and expanded telling of the story of Noah and the ark, as imagined by Darren Aronofsky. I’m a fan of much of Aronofsky’s work (particularly The Wrestler and Black Swan) so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt in tackling what appeared to be a dull subject. I was wrong to do so as there is almost nothing worthwhile in this movie. Visually, it’s horrendous: bad green screen, awful CG, and colour-graded in the least tactful way you can imagine. The story is overblown, the performances lack any subtlety, and the dialogue is, to a line, atrocious. I cannot begin to imagine why anyone thought this was worth filming having seen a script, but all we can do now is avoid it. One of the worst films in recent years. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/455007715744829440">my Noah Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>A few years ago The Raid was a surprisingly brilliant action movie, full of intricate choreography and a relentless pace, confined to a small tower block. <strong>The Raid 2</strong> sees the scope expand across many more characters and locations, but keeps the essence: a fair plot that is fast moving, but with stunning fights. The stunt set pieces throughout are brilliant. From the prison riot through the nightclub brawl, you won’t be disappointed. The story itself is a little more convoluted, and told out of order, but don’t let that throw you too much. Enjoy the action, enjoy the movie. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/457568494234923008">my The Raid 2 Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Calvary</strong> is a strangely dark story about a priest forced to represent the better side of humanity to a largely unseen antagonist (and a cast of other broken people), beyond what he should have to bear. While that sounds high concept, the film is very much grounded in humanity. Shot through with a dark humour, it’s an oddly affecting film that can be laugh out loud funny one minute and tense the next. From the look through to the performances, this film rarely slips. Exceptionally good. (See <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/459435336016207873">my Calvary Twitter review</a>).</p>

<p>The winner, as should be obvious, is <strong>Calvary</strong>; an unexpected gem.</p>

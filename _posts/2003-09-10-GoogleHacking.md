The [art of Google hacking](http://www.poetryandcoffee.com/archives/000113.php) is an excellent demonstration of the power of Google, and the idiocy of not controlling access to sensitive directories.

I&#8217;ve done a few slighty dodgy things like this before (not that it&#8217;s particularly wrong). Hint: don&#8217;t call your password files &#8220;passwd.txt&#8221; and leave the passes unhashed.

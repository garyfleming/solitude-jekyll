So the results are in from the second PHP challenge.

Runner-up was [Plix](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/CodeArchive/RNC/Plix.txt) with an entry that recursively slices a string of the numerals after comparing it to the number being thrown into the function. Quite clever, really. 236 bytes, in total.

Not clever enough, however, to beat [ZeroByte](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/CodeArchive/RNC/ZeroByte.txt) who also won the last challenge. Rather than putting the numerals into a string and slicing it, he put them into an array and just pulled them out (although he admits he doesn&#8217;t know how the code works &#8211; he adapted a JavaScript version). So there you have it. Congrats to ZeroByte (again) and Plix!

The next challenge will be set within a few days.

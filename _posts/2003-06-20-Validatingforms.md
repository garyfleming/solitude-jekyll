In a piece rightfully called [The Holy Grail](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/06/17/theHolyGrail "Simon Willison: Easier form validation"), [Simon](http://simon.incutio.com) has come up with a method of writing form validation routines in <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> much easier.

At the moment, validating form data is one of the most tedious things a developer can do. It&#8217;s a lot of effort for an important, but barely noticeable effect. I think I&#8217;ll be following the progress of this project very closely.

Just realised I hadn&#8217;t made the pre-exam post I had intended on doing. So, I&#8217;ll do it now. Since exams have started (2 down, 6 to go), post rate will drop to around nothing around here for the next 2-3 weeks. Final year, final exams.

It&#8217;s been a mixed bag so far. Information Retrieval was surprisingly alright, but Algorithmics was a fairly painful mix of wordy answers and unseen material. May the Gods smile on us tomorrow for the undoubted hell that will be Grid Computing: a subject so full of holes, half ideas and hand-waving that you can turn it into a <a href="/Archives/2005/04/20/GridComputingDrinkingGame" tilte="The Grid Computing drinking game">drinking game</a> so insane as to be able to take down Oliver Reed. Well, if he did Grid&#8230; And was not dead.

Anyway, toodles for now. If you&#8217;re at all interested in how the exams are going, [Derek](http://www.mrry.co.uk) is blogging the pain. He does the same modules as me, so I&#8217;ll try to comment on each of his posts on the matter. See you in a few weeks if I survive.

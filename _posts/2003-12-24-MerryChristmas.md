There are 2 hours or so until Christmas, so I thought I&#8217;d better say Merry Christmas to everyone who has ever read this site, to everyone who has left a comment (from some of the comments, it&#8217;s apparent that there are people who comment without reading), to all of my friends and family, and those that matter most to me: Merry Christmas!

As a bonus, have fun with this fun [Make A Snowflake](http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/) game. There are some jaw-dropping designs in the gallery.

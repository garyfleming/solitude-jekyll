Words fail me for a review of [**The Hulk**](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286716). While certainly not as bad as, say, [**Dreamcatcher**](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/05/03/#Dreamcatcher), it still ranks as one of the worst films of modern times.

The first hour or so is just tedious. A very obvious plot is frameworked, predictable plot devices planted, and paper thin relationships are set-up. So far, so boring. Then we get an array of highly stereotyped characters prancing around, pretending to act.

The editing doesn&#8217;t help matters. Why Ang Lee thought that using comic book framing would be good is beyond me. At the most serious moments, we get multiple views of each character in a boxed view moving around the screen; making watching it and taking it seriously a real chore.

The worst moment is the inevitable dream sequence (I did say it was bad). Bruce Banner sees the eponymous character in a mirror, who then pulls a bad [Morbo](http://www.geocities.com/zoidberg_fan/morbo.html) impression.

To be fair, I went in expecting it to be bad, but not this bad; Lou Ferrigno would be rolling in his grave if he was dead (and didn&#8217;t have a cameo in the damn thing).

**Anger Management** is an ok film &#8211; worthy of the few juvenile laughs it gets &#8211; as long as you can ignore the ridiculous yet utterly predictable plot, and realise that [Adam Sandler](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sandler,Adam) is far from a character actor. Or even an actor. Would I recommend you go see it? No. Wait for it to go to video. Or TV.

Somehow I&#8217;m in the Utah state government&#8217;s [<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> workshop](http://gils.utah.gov/rss/rssparsers.html) (towards the bottom). Anyone know how this happened?

It seems to be a fairly comprehensive list of RSS resources and techniques (but we&#8217;ll just keep it quiet that they&#8217;ve put me in the <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation"><acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language">XSL</acronym>T</acronym> section, despite my hatred for its ugly syntax).

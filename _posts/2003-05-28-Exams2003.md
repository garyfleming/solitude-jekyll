Today, _it_ started. Exams: the scourge of any self-respecting student. My first exam was today and it did not go well. So I&#8217;m going to get my head into the books for the next few exams (I have 9 in total). Ah, the joys of studying until your eyes twitch.

This, of course, means that I&#8217;ll have less time to devote to this corner of my life. Updates will be sporadic to non-existant until the 13th or so. I have a little gap in between exams that I&#8217;ll try to make some serious updates in. However, I&#8217;ve been prepared for a dry spell for quite some time. Living on my desktop is file full of quick ideas for posts, should the need arise to fill some space. Expect quite a few entries from that over the next few weeks.

Anyway, I have to get some sleep now. Another exam tomorrow: Information Management, <acronym title="Also Known As">AKA</acronym> databases, web design, professional issues and <acronym title="Human Computer Interaction">HCI</acronym>. Hooray for the hideous mish-mash that is computing!

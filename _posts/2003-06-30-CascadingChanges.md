I&#8217;ve made a few small changes over the past week or so that should make reading this site a bit easier:

  1. **Justified text** &#8211; text on all pages is now justified. This took a seconds worth of work and makes everything look a lot better. To anyone who doesn&#8217;t do this already, add `p {text-align: justify;}` to your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> immediately.
  2. **Smaller CSS** &#8211; The remaining CSS has been made more detailed, yet the file is smaller. If you&#8217;re seeing any weird effects during the change, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and <kbd>F5</kbd> together.
  3. Valid <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> for code &#8211; the code pages now show valid X<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> (where appropriate) rather than the default mish-mish. This is all thanks to [conversion code from Xiven](http://www.xiven.com/blog.php?start=26).
  4. **Meta tags changed** &#8211; Hopefully Google will actually figure out how to follow my permalinks now that I&#8217;ve updated my meta-tags.

As with most things, you probably won&#8217;t notice most of these changes. That&#8217;s a good thing: I like seamless changes.

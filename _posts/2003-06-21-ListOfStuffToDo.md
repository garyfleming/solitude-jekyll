I&#8217;ve spent a little bit of tonight thinking about all of the stuff that I need to do to bring my <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> to a reasonable level. I&#8217;ve spent the past while doing lots of minor updates to avoid thinking about the big parts. I&#8217;ve created a list of all the things that need done (in no particular order).

Most of this will be of absolutely no interest to anyone, but if I have this in public and update it frequently, I&#8217;ll probably work on it more often. So, without further ado, here it is:

  * Comments
  * Trackback
  * Pingback
  * New data structure (FinData)
  * Alpha indexing
  * Categories (pointers)
  * Search
  * Caching archives
  * New permalinks (/Archives/Title)
  * <del>Genericised <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> module</del>
  * Resolve relative links
  * Modularising archive code
  * Event handlers
  * Disentangle Add/edit components from ContentManager
  * Add <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> support (primarily bloggerAPI)
  * Change archive code to use a single DateString variable (rather than day/month.year)
  * Let every page (or listings thereof) be available as RSS or other formats
  * Data <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym> permalinks
  * Add an email form
  * Auto Convert <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>S to links
  * Update meta-links
  * User Management (add users, user levels)
  * Move no. of items per page to config
  * Redo content manager
  * Get edit and delete listings to actually work beyond first page
  * Get acronymit definitions done externally

Like I said, of very little interest or sense to anyone but me, but motivational nonetheless. Go about your business.

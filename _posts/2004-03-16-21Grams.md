Although certain people would have you believe that **21 Grams** involves intricate, interleaving plot lines coming together to form a carefully planned story, it doesn&#8217;t. After seeing it, you might agree with them, you&#8217;d be wrong.

The real intelligence behind the film is the editing. The whole thing has been cut to give a fairly bland story a sense of interest by showing what happens to various characters out of order. This has been done far more convincingly elsewhere (**Memento**, for example), with more imaginative reasoning behind it.

Despite this reliance on editing, 21 Grams is an ok film, but certainly not uplifting.

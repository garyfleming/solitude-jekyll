First bit of news for the month is that new band [Institute](http://institutemusic.com/) have finished work on their debut album. Featuring ex-Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale, it&#8217;s expected to be pretty decent and the first track, &#8220;Bullet-Proof Skin&#8221;, seems to indicate that (albeit only a portion of the track has emerged).

This month saw the finals of the [Emergenza UK](http://www.emergenzauk.co.uk/home.html) new band competition. Although I saw relatively little, what I did see was disappointing; a lot of derivative, talentless bands, doing nothing very interesting at all. The exception was Edinburgh&#8217;s [Amplifico](http://www.amplifico.net) who burst their way through in terms of both style, energy and performance. Pretty songs and a catchy chorus do a good band make. Ones to watch.

[Epitaph](http://www.epitaph.com) released the tenth annual Punk-O-Rama compilation CD at the start of the month. While it features far fewer exclusive tracks than in previous years, the quality remains high and the bonus DVD is, well, a bonus. It&#8217;s also in the mid-price sampler range, so should be fairly cheap.

Both [Idlewild](http://www.idlewild.co.uk) and [The Mars Volta](http://www.themarsvolta.com) released new singles this month; &#8220;El Capitan&#8221; and &#8220;L&#8217;via L&#8217;viaquez&#8221; respectively. Neither is worth getting. While the album the Mars Volta track is taken from is excellent, &#8220;The Bible and The Breathalyzer&#8221;is a typical piece of Mars Volta editing room trash put out as a B-side. The guys have serious talent, but they don&#8217;t make much of an effort for singles.

That&#8217;s all I know about this month, haven&#8217;t been paying a great deal of attention to music.

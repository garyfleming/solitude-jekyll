One of the best ideas I&#8217;ve seen implemented in a long time: take the [GeoURL tags](http://geourl.org) and the update list from [weblogs.com](http://www.weblogs.com), roll them together in a beautiful flash map, and watch the world update their sites in real-time. This is [the world as a blog](http://www.brainoff.com/geoblog/).

Since I ping weblogs.com and have geoURL tags, I&#8217;m going to sit watching the map for the next few minutes waiting for me to appear.

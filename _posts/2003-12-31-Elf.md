It should be plain that Will Ferrell is a comic genius. It&#8217;s a shame that his genius was wasted on **Elf**.

It&#8217;s a decent enough film (although it _is_ a kids film), but Ferrell doesn&#8217;t shine as he usually does; hampered by an exceptionally stupid character.

There are some great moments, but it could&#8217;ve been a good deal better.

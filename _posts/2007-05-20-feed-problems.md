Apologies for any recent feed problems you&#8217;ve been experiencing. As part of an effort to try and consolidate all my feeds (about 6), I&#8217;ve decided to outsource the URL to something a bit more permanent, in the form of [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com).

There was a rather silly problem with cyclical redirects, but it&#8217;s all sorted now. I advise that you change your subscription to the [Solitude FeedBurner Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/solitudevkps), if your feed reader of choice has not already done so.

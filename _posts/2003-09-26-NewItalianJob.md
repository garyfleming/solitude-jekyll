I didn&#8217;t initially hold out a lot of hope for **The Italian Job** remake. It seemed pointless, if not outright stupid, to recreate such a well-loved, classic film. Later, it became abundantly clear that they were using the name, the minis, and a few minor details.

A cash-in, then.

Unfortunate, certainly, but not entirely worthless. Judging the film on its own merits, it&#8217;s a very slightly above par film, marred only by how painfully slick it is. The amount of Hollywood polish begins to detract.

The film also suffers severely from trailer trashing; the practice of putting all the good bits in the trailer, thus ruining a lot of the film for those who remember the trailer.

All in all, not as bad as I expected, but nowhere near the original.

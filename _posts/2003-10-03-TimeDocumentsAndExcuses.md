I know I&#8217;ve been somewhat lax in posting the past few days. I&#8217;ve been fairly busy with the huge amounts of work expected of me in 3rd year university, so at least part of this week has involved several meetings to form a team for a large project (that will no doubt be the cause of much swearing and a few posts later in the year).

Anyway, it&#8217;s time for the (almost) weekly random links:

  * **[Best Practices For Time Travelers](http://www.idlewords.com/weblog.09.2003.html#293)** (sic) &#8211; Are you visiting from the future? This guide will tell you how to best mesmerise and dazzle us simple 21st century folk.
  * **[How To Write Bad Documentation That Looks Good](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/9/29/104212/112)** &#8211; Sabotage and obfuscate documents in a professional, orderly manner.
  * **[Tools For Weblogs](http://owrede.khm.de/2003/09/24#a869)** &#8211; A few handy tools for assistive weblogging.
  * **[Thirty Six Dramatic Situations](http://www.timsheppard.co.uk/story/articles/36drama.html)** &#8211; This apparently covers all possible situations in drama. To be honest, I expected less than 36.
  * **[<acronym title="Tim Berners Lee">TBL</acronym>&#8216;s semantic web map](http://cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=1032)** &#8211; The only man who has an internationally recognised acronym for his name has posted a subway like image of the semantic web.

Expect updates to stabilise more over the next week.

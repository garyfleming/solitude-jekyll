I know I&#8217;ve changed my permalinks before and really don&#8217;t like changing them at all, but today I finally got around to doing the work that allows them to be the way I want them to be.

They no longer have crufty parts, and each permalink goes to a page with that item and that item alone (previously it was a page containing any items from that day). So they&#8217;re now in the form: `/Archives/YEAR/MONTH/DAY/TITLE`. No closing extensions, no ids.

And since I couldn&#8217;t have my permalinks breaking, all previous forms of permalink still work and should continue to do so. Real content coming later, perhaps.

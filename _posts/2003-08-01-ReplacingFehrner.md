[Stuart Langridge](http://www.kryogenix.org) has come up with a better way of doing [image replacement with <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/lir/). It removes the redundant markup of the Fehrner technique, thereby silencing the critics of the method in at least one way.

Meanwhile, Tom Gilder continues his look at the future of CSS with an article on the [CSS3 border model](http://blog.tom.me.uk/2003/08/01/looking_ahead_to_css3_part_3_borders_without_the_bother.php). Looks like being very powerful stuff.

So, since the site is in it&#8217;s infancy, I need to link to the weblogging community in a general way for now. I joined a webring (see the navigation bar to the right): Scottish Blogs. Seems like I can&#8217;t keep away from connecting the wired world to the real world. This isn&#8217;t a real update, more of a notification.

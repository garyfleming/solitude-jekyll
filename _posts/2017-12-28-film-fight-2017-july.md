Another big month as the summer blockbusters hit and Netflix release a film a week. Seven in total for July...

First up, **The House** is a comedy that has its situation sorted, it just desperately needs a plot. The few story points that do exist are just there to set-up bits for the comedy. Some work, some don't. It definitely has funny moments but probably not enough. Meh. (See [my The House Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/881763023664406528))

**Okja** is the latest film by Joon-ho Bong, the South Korean director behind Snowpiercer. This is a very different film, looking at the abuses and lack of humanity in the modern livestock system. The story is reasonable enough and it is as well shot as you'd expect, but the goofier moments detract a lot from a fairly serious film. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, for example, appears to be in a completely different movie. Okay. (See [my Okja Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/884452068085424133))

There is a lot to be said about the privacy implications of social media that a film could really take a deep dive into but **The Circle** is not that film. While the cast is great (Emma Watson, Tom Hanks, John Boyega), the film itself is far too lightweight and superficial. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. Maybe a little disappointing but still watchable. (See [my The Circle Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/886667115675176961))

Was another Spiderman reboot really needed? No, but **Spiderman: Homecoming** makes it worth your while. Tom Holland is excellent as a breezy and fun take on the character, playing against Michael Keaton as one of the most menacing villains the MCU has seen. It's well-paced, fun, with decent set-pieces. Most importantly, it stands head and shoulders above recent Marvel films by doing something different rather than just fitting the mould. Very good.

**To The Bone** is a difficult watch but worthwhile, tackling the issues around eating disorders. It's thoughtful, and doesn't demonise the sufferers. There are moments of levity, and some solid performances. Worth seeing. (See [my To The Bone Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/887740654092267528))

Christopher Nolan tackling a war film? **Dunkirk** doesn't disappoint. From the start, the audio design is fantastic and absolutely gripping. The action is relentless. The pacing is tense. The minimal dialogue works brilliantly. This is a film that isn't afraid to be an audio-visual experience, without the crutch of exposition. Great.

Finally, **War for the Planet of the Apes** is the blockbuster action film you expect if you saw the last film in the series. Some of the story doesn't quite add up, and the last act in particular loses a lot of ground to stupid plotting, but we're here mostly for the performances. Andy Serkis deserves at least a nomination for his work as Caesar, bringing a great deal of humanity to a CG ape. Well acted and shot.

The winner for July is **Dunkirk**, as an incredible cinematic experience.

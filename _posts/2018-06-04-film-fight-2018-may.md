### The May Winner

Honestly, there are plenty of decent movies this month. I didn't dislike any of them... but I don't love any of them either. The strongest film, I think, is **Kodachrome**: a solid cast, doing something a little bit smaller scale than most of the others, in a way that the writing and acting gets to shine through.

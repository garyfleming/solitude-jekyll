A quick request: does anyone know of any good flash radio stations? The best one I&#8217;ve seen so far is the absolutely fantastic [Captain&#8217;s Of Industry player](http://www.captainsof.com/player2.html), featuring stuff by a lot of good rock bands.

Requirements: preferably rock, indie, metal, punk or otherwise listenable guitar and drums based music. It also has to use Macromedia flash to deliver the sound.

I&#8217;m asking because I want music to listen to in the lab, and I&#8217;m sick of trying to get Real player working on Linux.

Thanks.

The election is over. [Kerry has conceded](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3979367.stm), Bush has won. There was no fiasco this time. Bush got the electoral vote, and the popular vote. Another 4 years of not ratifying pre-arranged treaties, ignoring others fixed years ago and generally screwing over the world.

America you did it to yourself. The rest of us just happen to be in the way.

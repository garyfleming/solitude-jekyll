So, it&#8217;s happened once more. To turn it into an end of term tradition, some of my friends and I went bowling today. [The last time I went bowling](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/03/21/#BowlingBowlingBowling), my hand was all but crippled. This time it&#8217;s my knee. How that happened is anyones guess.

We played 10 games: each winning three before the big finale. The person who did worst last time absolutely stormed it this time, stealing the last game and ridiculing the rest of our scores.

On the plus side, I managed to get the high-score of the day: a modest 150. It&#8217;s probably my personal best.

Anyway, bowling might look like a sport for the lazy, but boy does it hurt if you&#8217;re not used to it. Ice-pack this way, please.

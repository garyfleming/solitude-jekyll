In **Charlies Angels 2** the action is weak, the plot laughable, the acting below par, the costumes skimpy (not necessarily a complaint), the plot devices clumsy and obvious, the comic relief inappropriate, the serious parts funny, the funny parts serious, the direction distracting, the music editing outright aggrevating (and I liked a fair few of the songs), the dialogue as weak as it comes&#8230; I could go on but I think you get the idea.

Money was thrown at this film. Marketing everywhere, and it still sucks. Thus proving that money means nothing in the world of cinema. Except that a million people will still go and see it because they&#8217;ve been told to. Shame.

I&#8217;ve been trying to think of a good term for a particular kind of music for a while now but nothing immediately springs to mind.

I&#8217;m thinking of albums that are technically solid, enjoyable to listen to, but entirely forgettable. The sort that you can&#8217;t say anything bad about but probably don&#8217;t listen to as much as you should; probably because there&#8217;s no particular reason to break it out. Maybe if you see the band live it spurs you to listen to them again, but the notion fades.

The particular album that spurred this doesn&#8217;t matter too much I just want a concise way of describing such an album.

Suggestions?

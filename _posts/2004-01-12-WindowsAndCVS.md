<acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym> is a powerful and useful tool. Unfortunately, running it on windows is not easy. Fortunately then, someone has produced an interesting tutorial on the matter entitled, &#8220;[CVS Version Control on Windows in 10 minutes](http://weblog.cemper.com/a/200307/28-cvs-version-control-on-windows-in-10-minutes.php)&#8220;.

I haven&#8217;t actually tried it (at the moment, I&#8217;m running CVS through [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)), but it seems fairly comprehensive. Definitely worth a look if you have documents that you want to keep backed-up or have more than one copy of.

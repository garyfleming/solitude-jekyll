Just before **Matrix Reloaded** came out, I made far too many posts about it and the rest of the Matrix universe (Animatrix, comics, propaganda etc.). After the mild disappointment of the film, I&#8217;m loathe to do it again for the third cinematic installment. I&#8217;ll be going to see it tomorrow (the day of release) but not at the first showing, as I had hoped. Oh well.

For those that don&#8217;t know (have you had your head under a rock?), Warner Bros are releasing the film simultaneously around the world; same day, same time. Thankfully, while Los Angeles will be getting it at the insane time of 6am, here in the UK it starts showing at the more reasonable 2pm.

Time for more random links:

  * **[SoundBridge](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/)** &#8211; Lets you use your PC as a jukebox, feeding audio devices around your house. Very nice bit of kit, if a little on the steep side.
  * **[Introspection and Blogging](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/03/11/introspection_is_the_enemy_of_blogging)** &#8211; Absolutely true. There is a file full of stuff I intend to write about, but anytime I think about it, I get too involved in thinking to write it.
  * **[<acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE7</acronym>](http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/)** &#8211; Absolutely phenomenal development. Bypass Internet Explorers lack of support for web standrds using proprietary javascript.
  * **[Ball Game](http://content.collegemix.com/games/41d1ed130582f1ac30fc7028f67005a2.swf)** &#8211; Flash game where you need to get all the red balls on one side, all the blue balls on the other. The time to beat is 31 seconds.
  * **[Blog Epidemic](http://www-idl.hpl.hp.com/blogstuff/)** &#8211; HP labs have come up with a tool to monitor memes passing through the blogosphere. Interesting.
  * **[Rounded Corners In <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>](http://www.virtuelvis.com/gallery/css/rounded/)** &#8211; Getting nice rounded corners. Doesn&#8217;t work in IE.
  * **[2DO Before I Die](http://www.2dobeforeidie.com/home.htm)** &#8211; Make a list of things to die before you die. How morbid.
  * **[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)** &#8211; Another plain text format for generating <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>.
  * **[Unicode Regular Expressions](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18-9.html)** &#8211; How to do regular expressions that involve the complications of unicode.
  * **[Technicolour](http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/Technicolor/)** &#8211; Create interesting colour schemes for websites. Came up with some nice ideas that might appear here in the future.
  * **[Penguin And Yeti](http://penguin.omnihosts.net/)** &#8211; The developing story of the Yeti game, featuring some bizarre modifications.

That&#8217;s all.

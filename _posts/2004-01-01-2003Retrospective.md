Happy New Year! The Christmas design is gone and it is time to get on with the best things in 2003 post. No reasons or commentary, just the picks.

**Best Albums**:

  1. &#8220;<cite>Deloused In The Comatorium</cite>&#8221; &#8211; The Mars Volta.
  2. &#8220;<cite>The Neon Handshake</cite>&#8221; &#8211; Hell Is For Heroes.
  3. &#8220;<cite>Once Like A Spark</cite>&#8221; &#8211; JetPlane Landing.

**Best Films** (starting from the summer):

  1. [Kill Bill, volume 1](/Archives/2003/10/21/KillBillVolume1).
  2. [Buffalo Soliders](/Archives/2003/07/22/LookItsLikeIToldYou).
  3. [Igby Goes Down](/Archives/2003/06/28/IgbyGoesWhere).

**Best code**:

  1. [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/).
  2. [Magnetic Poetry](http://diveintomark.org/magnetic/diveintomark.org).
  3. [Safe <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> Checker](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/02/23/safeHtmlChecker).

And that&#8217;s all for last year. This year my intentions are to finish at least one of the projects I&#8217;ve got in my head (one in particular is hooking me a lot right now, so I **need** to do it), as well as a major redesign (it&#8217;s sketched on paper somewhere, but it&#8217;ll take a while to actually do it) and a huge bit of course work for university.

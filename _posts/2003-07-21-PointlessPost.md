I apologise to everyone for this post: it is, as the title says, pointless. It&#8217;s for me to get a few things down now as a time marker. Feel free to read no further.

Today, I came closer than I&#8217;ve come before to getting fired. I didn&#8217;t do anything majorly wrong, just a few different small things working against me; mostly out of my control. Although, perhaps it was just unjustified worrying.

Either I&#8217;m spending more time online (summer holidays, after all) or people are updating far less (perhaps both), because I go through my rather substantial list of sites to visit every day now; it used to take a fortnight at least, with various sites being visited with varying frequency.

I&#8217;ve finally loaded my archive into [**Feedster**](http:/www.feedster.com). I don&#8217;t think it has been indexed yet though, since I can&#8217;t seem to find anything after using lines of text directly from old entries. Oh well.

**Thunderbird** is officially a great mail client. It is now my default.

I&#8217;m in the middle of redesigning my site and keep hitting walls. I&#8217;ve tried art deco style blocks of colour, shades of minty green, and a few other things. They all seem like great ideas in my head, but don&#8217;t pan out. Very frustrating.

Today, I got an email from [Dean Allen](http://www.textism.com) saying that I _can_ use [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) in Finetto (the <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> I&#8217;ve been working on for quite some time).

This is great news since it lets me focus on other areas of Finetto, without having to worry about processing text. Besides, the Textile system is fantastic at what it does. I couldn&#8217;t come up with better (you should see the cludges that hold the site together at the moment). Thanks, Dean!

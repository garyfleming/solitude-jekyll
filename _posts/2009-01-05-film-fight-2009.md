After failing dismally in the early parts of last year, I&#8217;m going to be giving [twittering Film Fight](/Archives/2008/01/15/film-fight-2008/) another chance (on [my twitter feed](http://twitter.com/garyfleming)). For anyone who didn&#8217;t see it last year, I&#8217;ll be writing film reviews before the later (and often delayed) monthly Film Fights with little snippets on twitter. Often this gives a slightly different perspective of the film, with less time for memory and external bias to change what I thought of the film.

I&#8217;m tempted to update twitter and not refer back to it for the film fight, so I can do a comparision of what I thought immediately and what I&#8217;m thinking now. We&#8217;ll see if that ever actually happens.

If you want to read the 2009 reviews but not the rest of my Twitter (which is occassionally more personal than Solitude), then use the [Film Fight &#8217;09 Twitter Search page](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23FF09+from%3Agaryfleming).

Let&#8217;s hope I get a little further into this year than last.

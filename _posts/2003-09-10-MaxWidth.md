Someone has done [a hacky max-width feature for <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>](http://www.svendtofte.com/code/max_width_in_ie/). I&#8217;m not sure what I think of it. It works well, and can easily be set up to also work in browsers which already support the feature. It can also be used as a basis to fix other similar problems with IE.

The problem is that it uses IE proprietary expressions, and thus uses invalid <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>. That&#8217;s bad. While I don&#8217;t know of any browsers that would choke on it, there are always some who will. Is it worth invalidating your CSS for IE again (ala the box model hack)? Maybe. The features this hack enables are very useful and, as such, should be enabled where possible.

Hmm. Possibly worth it, as long as it doesn&#8217;t break _any_ other browsers.

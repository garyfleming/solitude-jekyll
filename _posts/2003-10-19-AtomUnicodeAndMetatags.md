Here&#8217;s a slightly briefer version of the random links post that got tragically wiped yesterday:

  * **[<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> float tutorial](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/)** &#8211; Can&#8217;t get your head around floats in CSS? This is _the_ guide. Clear, concise and well illustrated; makes everything much easier,
  * **[Unicode Applications in <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>](http://www.randomchaos.com/document.php?source=php_and_unicode)** &#8211; A guide to getting PHP applications to use unicode. I haven&#8217;t tried it myself yet, but it looks quite good,
  * **[Multibyte String Functions](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php)** &#8211; Or PHP&#8217;s built-in unicode handling functions.
  * **[Secure Shell Access Instructions](http://www.siliconvalleyccie.com/linux-hn/ssh-server.htm)** &#8211; Everything you need to know about secure shell access (if you don&#8217;t know what that is, you don&#8217;t need to),
  * **[Atom <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym>](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/15/dive.html?page=2)** &#8211; Mark lays out a brief history of content management APIs followed by a close look at the upcoming Atom API. A must read for anyone working with content management or syndication,
  * **[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org)** &#8211; The Mozilla website has been redesigned by Dave Shea (of [Mezzoblue](http://www.mezzoblue.com)). It looks great, can&#8217;t wait for the rest,
  * **[Death Of A Metatag](http://www.searchenginewatch.com/sereport/article.php/2165061)** &#8211; It has been done: metatags are now dead. Don&#8217;t even think about indexing them (not that anyone does anymore),
  * **[<acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> Considered H.. awful](http://dannyayers.com/archives/001956.html)** &#8211; An outline of why the OPML serialisation format is piss poor. My own experiences with it are less than pleasant,
  * **[A 3d House In CSS](http://www.designdetector.com/tips/3DBorderDemo2.html)** &#8211; An interesting way of making art with CSS. Very clever,
  * **[Example User Stylesheets](http://www.squarefree.com/userstyles/)** &#8211; Pretty much what it says on the tin: examples of user stylesheets.
  * **[PHP Scalability](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/10/15/php_scalability.html)** &#8211; An article on how scalable PHP is. If it is good enough for [Scott](http://www.fuzzyblog.com/) to build [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com), then it&#8217;s good enough for me.

Quite tech heavy; I&#8217;ll try to make the next link post a little lighter.

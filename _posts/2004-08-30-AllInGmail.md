In an interesting development for [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com) account holders, they can now mount their account as a linux file system thanks to [GmailFS](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html). According to the site (and various other testers I&#8217;ve spoken to), you can use all your standard unix commands to utilise that extra gig of off-site storage. Very nice.

Now imagine <acronym title="Network File System">NFS</acronym>ing a bunch of gmail accounts together to provide near unlimited storage. It will happen. Oh yes, it will happen.

Even nicer than that though is the fact that I got a gmail account just yesterday (gary.fleming@gmail.com). Looking forward to trying out all these little toys.

It&#8217;s about time for another random link post. Because I&#8217;ve been tied up with work this week, some of this is old news, but I&#8217;ll propagate it anyway.

  * **[Skinning in Seoul](http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100220)** &#8211; A fascinating look at the things being done with mobiles in the East. I know I want the phone with the built-in TV,
  * **[Regex Blog](http://www.regexblogs.com/)** &#8211; A blog about regular expressions. A bit of a dry subject, certainly, but this is the sort of thing that will come in handy for a lot of developers,
  * **[A Life Without Tivo](http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/default.asp#1111200389)** &#8211; A child who has never known TV without a <acronym title="Personal Video Recorder">PVR</acronym> thinks any other TV is broken. The marketing people will have a field day,
  * **[Devkit Advance](http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2003/11/06/devkit_advance.html)** &#8211; Programming GameBoy Advances. A bit niche, but interesting,
  * **[Nokia N-Gage cracked](http://games.slashdot.org/games/03/11/11/177247.shtml?tid=100&tid=127&tid=137&tid=186)** &#8211; Security on the new N-Gage has been cracked already, allowing games to be run on other mobiles,
  * **[Let Them Sing It For You](http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/src/sing/default.asp)** &#8211; Type in some song lyrics, and you&#8217;ll get an interpretation back taken from words in other songs. Bizarre,
  * **[Family Guy could be coming back](http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-11-18-family-guy_x.htm)** &#8211; Excellent news. Due to high <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> sales, Family Guy might be getting revived
  * **[First Galaxy Jedi](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/starwarsgalaxiesaned/news_6081665.html)** &#8211; In the new <acronym title="Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game">MMORPG</acronym> Star Wars: Galaxies, the first Jedi have appeared. Within hours, a bounty was on their heads. Very appropriate,
  * **[<acronym title="Friend of a Friend vocabulary">FOAF</acronym>Finger](http://rdfweb.org/people/damian/foaffinger/)** &#8211; Using FOAF to provide a rich fingering repository (no jokes, please),
  * **[Ninja Monkeys](http://www.iratescotsman.com/index.php/university/ninja_monkeys.html)** &#8211; And finally, some pictures of my friends and I pulling ninja poses in the 3rd year computing lab of Glasgow University. Why? Why not.

Some really good stuff today. Enjoy.

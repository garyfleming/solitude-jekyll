This was going to be a random links post, a fairly lengthy one at that. But before I submitted it, my login session ran out and the entire post got rejected. Ouch. I&#8217;ll rewrite it tomorrow (with even more links), but for now I&#8217;ll just hang my head and curse the way browsers won&#8217;t let you go back to retrieve your precious data.

This week&#8217;s random links:

  * **[Sliding Doors 2](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors2/)** &#8211; Not content with doing the finest <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> tabs tutorial to date, a week later we get more. Does Doug Bowman sleep?,
  * **[Keyboard Advance](http://digilander.libero.it/franapoli/keyboardadvance/About.htm)** &#8211; Use your GameBoy Advance as a basic word processor. Clever, but only for those who want to do all that swapping melarkey,
  * **[Unfinished Jokes](http://www.idler.co.uk/html/library/unfinished.htm)** &#8211; Louis Theroux (genius among men) has perfected a new comic form (&#8221; In Roman/biblical times, a chariot is being driven quickly, despite wet weather. Something about Antioch braking.&#8221;),
  * **[eBay Pet Auction](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3146042998)** &#8211; A little depressing, but very funny (via [Anil](http://www.dashes.com/anil)),
  * **[QuirkMode](http://www.quirksmode.org/home.html)** &#8211; Work around browser bugs with this comprehensive guide,
  * **[Analyis Of <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym> copy protection](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/cd3/)** &#8211; Exactly what it claims to be,
  * **[Local Feeds: Glasgow](http://localfeeds.com/near/?city=253&dist=20)** &#8211; A news feed for blogs and sites near Glasgow (other cities worldwide available, but this is the one I appear on dammit),

And we&#8217;re done.

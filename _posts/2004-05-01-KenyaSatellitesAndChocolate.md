Time for some more random links:

  * **[Only In Kenya](http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/29/)** &#8211; From the mind that brought us a flash animation about Badgers, comes one about lions in kenya.
  * **[DCC2](http://dcc2.org/)** &#8211; The beginnings of an overhaul of the classic IRC connection protocol. Good stuff.
  * **[Passwords For Chocolate](http://www.securitypipeline.com/news/18902074)** &#8211; Most people will trade their passwords for chocolate, once again showing that people are the weakest links in security systems.
  * **[Derren Brown: Inside Your Mind](http://www.brianmung.com/derrenbrown/)** &#8211; Use Derren Brown&#8217;s mind tricks to explode other magicians heads. No, really.
  * **[10 Worst Album Covers Of All Time](http://porktornado.diaryland.com/albumcover.html)** &#8211; Some really great album covers on display.
  * **[GameBoy Advance JPEG viewer](http://www.caimans.net/gba/)** &#8211; Look at pictures on your <acronym title="Gigabyte">GB</acronym>A.
  * **[Tarantino Meets A Nobody](http://hollywoodlog.typepad.com/hollywoodlog/2004/04/spontaneous_day.html)** &#8211; An odd tale of when a nobody spends a day with Tarantino.
  * **[Ping-O-Matic](http://pingomatic.com/)** &#8211; Ping everyone, let God sort it out.
  * **[Satellite View](http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/satellite.html)** &#8211; See Earth from one of dozens of orbitting satellites.
  * **[300 Images](http://www.intersmash.com/300images/)** &#8211; Some really good arrows and icons that should be stolen on a future project.
  * **[HTTP over <acronym title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP</acronym>](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/01/SRRH)** &#8211; A lot of discussion on this one is appearing, but Tim Bray sums it up best. A bizarre idea.
  * **[Floats](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/floats.htm)** &#8211; A tricky little flash game of grouping moving blobs. Fun.

Done. Posting rates will inevitably drop for the next month or so, as exams are once again imminent.

A great month for films, but not terribly good for the cinema. I only saw two of the six films at a cinema, and there was really not much to see on the big screen.

### The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

### The December Winner

A genuinely tough month with two film of the year contenders, but I think it has to be **Roma**. Beautifully shot, fantastically constructed, artful and technically brilliant, with moments of tension and profound sadness; I cried more than once.

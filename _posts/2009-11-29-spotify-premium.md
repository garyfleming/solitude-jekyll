When I first wrote about my Spotify Premium sign-up, back in [Spotify: Week One](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2009/11/10/spotify-week-one/), I had intended to do a quick update on how that was panning out each week until I had decided which way to go on a more permanent sign-up. As you&#8217;ve seen, that&#8217;s not really panned out.

I like Spotify. I like how fantastic it is for finding new music, being able to delve into recommendations you&#8217;ve had without a massive outlay. Several times over the last few weeks someone has said they like an album and I&#8217;ve been listening to it within minutes. That, to me, is excellent and almost certainly a game-changer.

The problem is that I don&#8217;t actually use it all that much. Several restrictions (that are outside Spotify&#8217;s control) make it less valuable to me:

  1. Not being able to use it in the background. This is a killer for me. I only use Spotify on my iPhone and not being able to switch out to Notes or Tweetie is a real problem, as I do that all the time. I don&#8217;t like having to plan my usage of these other apps around the music I&#8217;m listening to and vice-versa.
  2. Lack of decent 3G signal. I work in the city centre with a decent enough 3G signal, but still can&#8217;t get a good enough signal to stream an entire album. Typically, I&#8217;ve made it half-way through an album before having to pause to let the data catch-up. That&#8217;s not very useful.

Like I say, for these issues, Spotify is not to blame but I don&#8217;t feel I can live with them just now. I&#8217;m somewhat sad to say that I have not continued my Premium subscription, but may try it again in the future (if I Jailbreak, for example).

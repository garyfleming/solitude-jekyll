The last random link post for quite some time, so enjoy:

  * **[<acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym> Stuff](http://www.dnsstuff.com/)** &#8211; All the DNS and pinging tools you&#8217;ll need in a single interface.
  * **[Programming Fonts](http://www.tactile3d.com/tristan/)** &#8211; Fonts designed especially to make programming easier. Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve tried them but they look pretty good.
  * **[Eclipse Plugins](http://www.eclipse-plugins.info/eclipse/index.jsp)** &#8211; All the plugins you&#8217;ll ever need for the Eclipse environment.
  * **[Symbol Signs](http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=symbolsigns)** &#8211; A selection of common symbols to be used as you see fit. Lots of potential for web design in there.
  * **[Super Mario War](http://jnrdev.weed-crew.net/smw/)** &#8211; A very fun game multiplayer game, based on Super Mario Bros 3. Can&#8217;t wait for the networked version.
  * **[Shocking Validator Error](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2004May/0332.html)** &#8211; Very distressing news for anyone who has followed the validator.
  * **[Easy Snapshots With Rsync](http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/)** &#8211; A very interesting tutorial for making backups with the network friendly `rsync` tool.
  * **[Japanese For The Western Brain](http://www.mindspring.com/~kimall/Japanese/)** &#8211; The basics of Japanese form for those more accustomed to English.
  * **[Elements Of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/)** &#8211; The more tricky parts of English form for those who are not accustomed to it.
  * **[Multilingual Applications in <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>](http://www.randomchaos.com/document.php?source=php_and_unicode)** &#8211; A solid enough guide to building unicode applications in PHP.
  * **[PreReview](http://homepage.mac.com/joester5/prereview/)** &#8211; Reviews of films before the author has seen them (based on trailers). Very funny in places.
  * **[Web Forms 2.0](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/webforms2.html)** &#8211; An effort to bring sane processing to the world of forms on the internet. Could be very handy, but the Javascript area is a real no.
  * **[Stat Analysis: The Game](http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,63767,00.html)** &#8211; A Theme Park style interface to web stats. A good idea, but I wonder who would use it? Any real server admin isn&#8217;t going to go near it, and not many other people need web stats.
  * **[Bush Game](http://www.emogame.com/bushgame.html)** &#8211; Control Hulk Hogan, Mr. T and others on a quest to stop Bush. Really quite fun once you&#8217;re past the tediously long introduction.
  * **[Bypass Internet Censorship](http://www.peacefire.org/bypass/Proxy/akamai.html)** &#8211; It&#8217;s possible to bypass blacklisted websites using the Akamai network. Sure someone will find this useful.
  * **[Catching Web Standards](http://westciv.typepad.com/dog_or_higher/2004/06/catching_web_st.html)** &#8211; A mildly amusing tale of why web standards are promoted.
  * **[Nim Games In Java](http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/05/18/nim1.html)** &#8211; Write a game like 21 in Java. Who needs drinking buddies now?
  * **[GZip Hassles](http://philringnalda.com/blog/2004/06/gzip_well_sometimes_its_simple.php)** &#8211; Sometimes GZip can be a troublesome technology (but I still use it for most things on this site).
  * **[CodeKata](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata)** &#8211; Exercises in coding. Learn how to be a stronger programmer.
  * **[Priceclash](http://www.priceclash.co.uk/)** &#8211; A reasonable price comparision service. Not too good for music though, unless you have very mainstream tastes.
  * **[Kung Fu Mixer](http://skop.com/brucelee/)** &#8211; A flash mixer to create your very own kung fu montage.

That&#8217;s the lot.

The order in [which](http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000427.php "Theory of evolution: Just a theory?") [things](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/a_historian_disgraces_himself/ "A rebuttal of previously linked claims against evolution") [happen](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-196-1619264,00.html "Further.").

Those who say evolution is just a theory simply do not understand the meaning of the word &#8220;theory&#8221;. Evolution is fact. It just doesn&#8217;t explain everything (yet). Investigate further, rather than assuming that intelligent design is therefore right by default (a bizarre and illogical conclusion).

After about a year of hassle and countless arguments about the worth of social networks in general, I&#8217;ve finally done the (near) unthinkable and gotten a myspace page. You can find me, surprisingly enough, under the [VKPS](http://www.myspace.com/vkps) user name.

Why the change of heart? It wasn&#8217;t the getting slightly annoyed with people after every &#8220;What&#8217;s your myspace address?&#8221; question and ensuing debate (people can&#8217;t accept that it&#8217;s a pretty worthless site when you keep in touch with your friends and don&#8217;t really want a whole bunch of imaginary ones). It was the publishing of Mike Davidson&#8217;s guide to [hacking a more tasteful myspace](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts). I might not be much of a graphic designer or artist, but I know that the default design and masses of garish colour schemes and poor typography just wasn&#8217;t for me; I couldn&#8217;t put my name to it. Admittedly, I&#8217;ve done very little to the design I&#8217;ve put up, beyond the default hack; but it&#8217;s a simple, tasteful style that I can live with.

Speaking of design, I&#8217;ve started playing around with ideas for the next Solitude design. Current front-runner is based on picture I made (modified from stock photo) that I like to call [Red Winter](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vkps/134446489/). I&#8217;ve got a few ideas of where that image might take the design, various variations in layout and structure but I definitely like the natural touch in the design. Incidentally, since a few people have commented on the current Solitude &#8220;Sunflower&#8221; logo, I want to put out that it&#8217;s not a flower. It&#8217;s actually a very heavily distorted picture of a star (blurring and colour bleeding used through-out).

Of course, don&#8217;t expect to see a finished design for, oh, another year at this rate.

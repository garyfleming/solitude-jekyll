Since my random links bar was bloated already, I thought I&#8217;d post early:

  * **[Scott Johnson under the iron](http://iron.wootest.net/scott_johnson.php)** &#8211; Creator of [Feedster](http://feedster.com) and nice guy gets interviewed,
  * **[New Scrabble Proposal](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/23/ntxt23.xml&sSheet=/portal/2003/11/23/ixportal.html)** &#8211; Some idiots want to put txt-spk into the official Scrabble word set. Better idea: let&#8217;s remove them from &#8220;conversational&#8221; English instead,
  * **[How Regexes Work](http://perl.plover.com/Regex/article.html)** &#8211; Fascinating look at how regular expressions work, not how to use them, but how the language converts them into machines and does state manipulation,
  * **[Blizzard Chess](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/7/13/02752/5668)** &#8211; A new patch is out for chess,
  * **[Progressive Chess](http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/chess/Chess/Trivia/OldRules.html)** &#8211; How the rules of chess have changed over the years, including making the Queen so damn powerful,
  * **[<acronym title="Friend of a Friend vocabulary">FOAF</acronym> splinters into 10 groups](http://www.denounce.com/foaf.html)** &#8211; The FOAF group have split into 10 different organisations. Very funny,
  * **[<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> Underscore Hack](http://www.pixy.cz/blogg/clanky/cssunderscorehack/)** &#8211; Yet another way of targeting <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> users,
  * **[Stroke gives women British accent](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3235934.stm)** &#8211; Imagine: brain damage that can make you sound better.

And that&#8217;s all.

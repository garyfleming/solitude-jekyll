A man arrested for insider dealing has [claimed he is a time traveller](http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html). In trying to explain how he went from $800 dollars to a portfolio worth $350m he claimed he was from 200 years in the future.

The full article adds some odd details but I, [like others](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/03/29/#timeTravellerInsiderTrading "Simon Willison talks about the time traveller") suspect this is an early April Fool&#8217;s Joke.

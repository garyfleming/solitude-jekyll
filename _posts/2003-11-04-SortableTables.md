I&#8217;m in awe at how simple and powerful [Stuart Langridge](http://www.kryogenix.org)&#8216;s new script is: [Sortable Tables](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/) is a javascript that does exactly what it says (an attribute I like in scripts), it sorts tables.

The code is clean, fast and, from what I&#8217;ve seen, widely compatible. Nicely done.

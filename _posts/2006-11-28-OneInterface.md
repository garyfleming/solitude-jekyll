Raymond Chen has reasonably pointed out that most low-end users [don&#8217;t like using the search boxes](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/27/1160055.aspx) that modern browsers provide in addition to address bars. I couldn&#8217;t agree more.

The first thing I do with any new FireFox install, before loading up bookmarks or any of my favourite extensions, is to remove the search bar. Why?

  1. Ease of use. I don&#8217;t want to have to think about which box I&#8217;m going to use for a particular action, especially when the most common action is using Google: which works equally well in both boxes.
  2. Address bar is faster. Any time you move your hands from the keyboard to the mouse, you lose a significant portion of time. I don&#8217;t know if the search bar has a keyboard shortcut, but I know that the address bar does (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd>). Even if it does, how do I then quickly select a different search engine than the default?
  3. The address bar is multi-functional. I can use it for <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s and google, but if I add some keyword searches to my bookmarks (replace the query string `%s` and add a keyword), then I can have any search engine I want at my finger tips.

This makes the search box dead space in a prime location. It&#8217;s one (recent) saving is the addition of Google-style autocomplete. With a little more work this could, and should, be integrated into the address bar. At the very least, the option should be available.

So, what other things do I use the address bar quick search for?

  * [Javadoc](http://javadocs.org) &#8211; Look up any standard class with a quick &#8220;jdoc Class&#8221;.
  * [Man pages](http://man.splitbrain.org/) &#8211; As with terminals, &#8220;man [program]&#8221; works just fine for looking up UNIX stuff.
  * [Acronyms](http://acronymfinder.com) &#8211; Need to know what something means ASAP? &#8220;acronym ASAP&#8221; would do.

I use it for dictionaries (&#8220;dic&#8221;), the thesaurus (&#8220;thes), torrents (&#8220;torr&#8221;), and just about any other common search because _it is better_. Give it a try.

Earlier this week, I&#8217;d been thinking about the possibilites that greatly increased bandwidth (a few Gigabytes a second) would provide; specifically, in terms of non-local computing. By utilising remote procedure call formats, it would be more than possible to do all non-trivial processing at other locations.

Today, I came across a link to the [online Java compiler](http://www.physci.org/javac.jsp), via comp.lang.java.help. Although, I can&#8217;t think of any real practical use for it (other than testing if code is small and self-contained), it does show some of the potential in non-local computing.

Imagine a future version where you pass it a `tar` file with a huge bunch of source code (and possibly a `make` file), let it do the overnight processing and return a binary. That would be nice.

Over the last week, I&#8217;ve very slowly been migrating Solitude (and all other parts of the near enough non-existant VKPS empire) to a new home over at [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?405740). If you&#8217;ve seen anything go wrong, that&#8217;s probably why. Comments had been disabled briefly to allow for the move, but should be working now. If you see anything wrong, I&#8217;d appreciate if you&#8217;d let me know.

Why did I move hosts? My old hosts were great (in that they were very cheap and reasonably reliable) but they weren&#8217;t keeping their featureset up to date any more. PHP 4 just doesn&#8217;t cut it, and recently I was getting database outages twice a week. That was enough for me to seek out a new host.

By all accounts, except for a few well publicised outages, Dreamhost offer a great package. For Â£60 a year I got 500Gb of space, 5Tb of bandwidth, subversion, and shell access. Compared to my old package, that is ridiculous.

As I say, any problems with any page, please contact me.

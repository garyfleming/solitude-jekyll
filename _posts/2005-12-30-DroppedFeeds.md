Given that a new year is almost upon us, I figured it is a good time to get rid of the feeds I do not read any more. Before this cull, I had 218 feeds in Bloglines. That&#8217;s a fair number to keep up with and I don&#8217;t think my unread items count has dropped below a thousand in months now. Here&#8217;s what has been removed:

  * **[Scary Duck](http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/)** &#8211; It&#8217;s not gone any worse, it just hasn&#8217;t changed at all. I just don&#8217;t read it any more.
  * **[Query Letters I Love](http://queryletters.blogspot.com/)** &#8211; Not entertaining enough any more for the throughput.
  * **[New Urban Legends](http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp)** &#8211; Debunking urban legends. Good reference, but not feed worthy.
  * **[World Wide Words](http://www.worldwidewords.org/)** &#8211; Why I ever subscribed to this is beyond me. Resolutely dull.
  * **[Code Snippets](http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/?rss=)** &#8211; When most of the examples are so out of context and badly done, I don&#8217;t want to sift through them in a feed reader for the few gems.
  * **[The Religious Policeman](http://muttawa.blogspot.com/)** &#8211; A well meaning site on the situation in Saudia Arabia, but one whose jaded writing has become more and more stilted.
  * **[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)** &#8211; A signal to noise problem: not consistently interesting enough to read.
  * **[Astronomy Picture Of The Day](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050812.html)** &#8211; Although some of the pictures can be quite stunning, there are only so many nebulas I can find interesting. That number was reached some time ago.
  * **[Guardian Unlimited](http://www.guardian.co.uk/0,6961,603247,00.html?gusrc=rss)** &#8211; Again, a signal to noise issue. Of the several hundred items a week, I read maybe 2. Time for it to go.

Far more than that shall be going, but it&#8217;s a good start.

Observations:

Time of Expectation
:   The period in which a Linux user believes a few simple additions are all that are needed for Linux on the mainstream desktop. &#8220;When we get better wireless support, then we&#8217;ll be ready for the desktop&#8221;.

Time of Denial
:   The period in which a Linux user evangelises to non-technical family and friends about Linux. &#8220;You can play all your games now, so there&#8217;s no reason to keep paying Microsoft&#8221;. This is sometimes known as the Time of Delusion, as they become deluded that anyone in the mainstream cares.

Time of Realisation
:   The period in which a Linux user realises that Linux isn&#8217;t ready for the mainstream after all. Usually after an incident caused by the Time of Denial: &#8220;I guess piping command line arguments out of files and into other processes is a little obscure, Grandma.&#8221;

If you think the problem is **technical**, you&#8217;re almost certainly wrong. We can fix all the holes we see in Linux support, that&#8217;s really the easy part. What we&#8217;ll never end up with is something that normal users will see as normal. We&#8217;ll never create what they&#8217;re used to, because we&#8217;re not trying to create that; we want something better.

No, the problem is **social**. People need to be educated about what makes a good system, about all the options available, about secure practices, about strengths and weaknesses. That&#8217;s a hard problem, and it&#8217;s one that your compiler can do very little to help you with.

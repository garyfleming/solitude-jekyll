Yes, time for some more random links, from random places&#8230; randomly.

[The Copyright Cage](http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/July-August-2003/feature_zittrain_julaug03.html) is a long article about peculiarites in the copyright system, how arbitary it is, and how copyright law is being shifted away from society. Worth slogging through.

Over on Digital Web, [Dave Shea](http://www.mezzoblue.com) is [defending Fehrner Image Replacement](http://digital-web.com/features/feature_2003-08.shtml). It uses powerful examples, way beyond the scope that I&#8217;d thought was possible from the technique. This could be something worth playing with some more.

There is an interesting article on Idle Words about [the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> &#8220;conflict&#8221;](http://www.idlewords.com/weblog.08.2003.html#242), or lack of.

And finally, [trained hawks attack a dog](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=519&ncid=519&e=4&u=/ap/20030806/ap_on_re_us/hawk_attack_2). Fun.

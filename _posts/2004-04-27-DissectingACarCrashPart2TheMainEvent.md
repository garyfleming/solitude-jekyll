There are three main components of any car crash, although they do not seem to occur in the order one might expect. The crash itself (part 2) happens first.

A crunching, visceral impact; invariably wrenching you forward, hopefully snapping against a seat belt. Debris gains momentum, clashing against anything in the way. The most innocuous of items causes severe damage to those nearby.

A black out. Dead time wasted. A slow realisation the impact is over and the bleeding begins.

An indeterminate paralysis and a cry for help; someone might find you soon, maybe you&#8217;ll be alone for a long time.

It&#8217;s too early to know if you&#8217;ve survived: blood pumps fast, dizziness and nauseousness cloud the senses, and feelings of dread conflict with delirium.

You&#8217;ll either make it to Part 3 or you won&#8217;t.

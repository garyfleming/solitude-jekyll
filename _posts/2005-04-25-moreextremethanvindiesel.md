I&#8217;m a man who knows a lot about Vin Diesel (having clocked up at least 15 hours in the last week refreshing the [Vin Diesel fact page](http://4q.cc/vin/)) and I think he would be angered over the sequel to his ground-breaking work in **xXx**. Who can forget the bike that somehow hit a ramp with a 2 degree incline and got about 40ft of air? Or that boat? Or the bit with the great acting?

Let&#8217;s start with the name: **xXx2: The Next Level**. Christ in a glove, how can they pack the title with any more hyperbole? First there are 3 bloody X characters (the X is for eXtreme). Attention grabbing. Then there is a 2. On the posters I believe the 2 is actually superscript, so that&#8217;s xXx squared: giving, if my maths hasn&#8217;t failed me yet, 9 X&#8217;s. When you think &#8220;Goddamn, that name is just eXtreme enough&#8221;, they throw in a colon and a subtitle &#8220;The Next Level&#8221;. Wow. What a load of shite.

Second, Xander Cage is dead? Like Vin is actually killable. My arse. Ice Cube plays the new xXx who is apparently &#8220;more extreme, more angry, more black&#8221; than his predecessor (I&#8217;m fairly sure that Sammy Jackson says that in the trailer).

Finally, it&#8217;s advertised as being by the director of **Die Another Day**. Honest to Bob (Hope, that is), why would any sane person mention that someone who touched Die Another Day had gotten within 50 miles of filming? Didn&#8217;t they spend months hunting that fucker down and found him in a hole begging for his life? Wait, that was Saddam but it should&#8217;ve been him, dammit! DAD was easily the worst Bond film in years. Stupid bad guy (diamond face), satellite plot nicked from Goldeneye (a fantastic Bond film), poor swordplay (no-one has ever had a real sword fight that went on more than 2 minutes), invisible car (oh fucking dear), bland Bond girl (who the hell was it anyway?), face swapping (Face-Off theft), and a shit ending to the imprisonment we see at the beginning. What a pile of crap DAD was. Honestly, I could go on all day about that shit, but we&#8217;re here to talk about XXX2:Hardass, Punk Bitches From HELL.

I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll make enough money for the producers to ejaculate in nightly without fear of having to use any of the tained sample to buy a new yacht, but it still looks a bit pish.

Hollywood sequels, eh?

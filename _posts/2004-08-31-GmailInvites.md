Although I seriously doubt that anyone who wants one doesn&#8217;t have one already, I have a few Gmail invites available. Actually, I have 1 left now (after giving several to friends). So if you want it, post in the comments. Possibly leave a joke.

<ins>Update: Ok, I have another 5 invites to give away. You know what to do.</ins>

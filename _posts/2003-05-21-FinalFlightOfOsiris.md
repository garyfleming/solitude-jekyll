Attention to my <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> readers! As [I mentioned a few days ago](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030517231828 "Talking about the Animatrix shorts"), **Final Flight Of Osiris** is the only [Animatrix](http://www.intothematrix.com) short film currently showing that is not available from the website. However, Channel 5 is showing it tonight at 11:35 <acronym title="Post Meridiem">PM</acronym> straight after they show **The Matrix**.

Anyone who hasn&#8217;t yet seen it should watch it tonight, rather than go see Dreamcatcher.

It&#8217;s always great when I can shape a random links post into some sort of tenacious collection. This time it&#8217;s language:

  * **[Scrambling Words](http://jwz.livejournal.com/256229.html)** &#8211; If you scramble letters in a word (leaving the first and last letter the same), you can still read sentences full of garbled text. An odd bit of pattern matching on behalf of the brain. Via [Aquarionics](http://www.aquarionics.com/).
  * **[The Shizzolator](http://www.asksnoop.com/)** &#8211; Shizzles up any site. Not particularly effective on this site. However, a few random bits get through, making it funny enough.
  * **[Tim Bray has cracked](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/14/Read)** &#8211; He&#8217;s suggesting that we use &#8220;read&#8221; and &#8220;readd&#8221; to tighten up the English language a bit. Reminds me of [Mark Twain&#8217;s improvements](http://www.i18nguy.com/twain.html).

Like I said, tenacious&#8230; That&#8217;s all for today.

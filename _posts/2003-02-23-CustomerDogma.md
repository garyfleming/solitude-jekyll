In the film Dogma, the universe is based on the fact that &#8220;God is infallible&#8221;. Breach of this idea would cause the universe to cease existing; to be uncreated.

Something I realised today: we should all be eternally grateful that the same consequences do not apply to a breach of the old saying &#8220;the customer is never wrong&#8221;. Uncreated a billion times over. At least.

This week marks my last batch of exams for this session at university (thankfully). So, while huge updates will be appearing over the forthcoming months of summer nothingness, the next week will see this place almost turned into a desert. Sorry, but it&#8217;s going to be an intense few days of studying, catching up with people who I&#8217;ve had to side-line for the past few weeks, and generally celebrating the end.

After that though, big things. Including, but not limited to, an idea I&#8217;ve had for a long time now which will amount to an entirely new way of looking at this site. But that is then and this is now.

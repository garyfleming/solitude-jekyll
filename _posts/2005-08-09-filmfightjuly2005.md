A simple two way film fight this month.

First up is Steven Spielberg&#8217;s remake of **War of the Worlds**, another film that was good the first time but they decided to mess with anyway. Genius. In all honesty, it&#8217;s not a terrible film, when taken as a dumb visual spectacle. There are plot holes you could drive a tripod through (camcorders unaffected by EMP, plot important streets being the only ones unaffected, etc), and the story surrounding our heroe&#8217;s family is annoying and superflous, but it doesn&#8217;t matter all that much. It&#8217;s still a good watch.

The contender is **Silver City**: a film that opens with some very subtle humour and, unusually for American films, dry wit. It degenerates into a total farce featuring some of the worst acting and dialogue imaginable. Who, I ask you, who thought it was a neat idea to make a joke out of irregular verbs? You, my friend, are wrong. Worse than this is the fact the plot begins to move in so many directions that it gets nowhere and falls on its arse. The director should&#8217;ve cut, oh, minutes into the film. Abysmal.

Strangely, War of the Worlds wins.

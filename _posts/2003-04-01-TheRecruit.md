Right from the outset, the most annoying thing about going to see &#8220;The Recruit&#8221; was having seen the trailer. Now, you might be thinking that if I thought the trailer was bad, then I shouldn&#8217;t have gone in the first place and should stop my incessant moaning. But you&#8217;d be wrong. I didn&#8217;t think the trailer was bad, but I suspected that it would ruin the film for me. And it did. The film has a final twist (although I&#8217;m sure you would see it coming anyway) that is revealed in the trailer.

&#8220;Surely a bluff,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t give away the ending before anyone had seen the film.&#8221;

Oh, how I was wrong.

I won&#8217;t tell you what is revealed in the trailer, however. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, go watch the film; you&#8217;ll enjoy it more than anyone who has. If you have seen the trailer, then go see the film anyway. Sure, you&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s going on, but it won&#8217;t stop it from being a decent film.

But, Big Movie Studios: Stop giving away big plot points in the trailers. We don&#8217;t want to know!

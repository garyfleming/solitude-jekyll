Recently, several individuals (Bill Gates included) have been [advocating buying &#8220;stamps&#8221; to send emails](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/03/05/spam.charge.ap/index.html) in an effort to stop spam. The two mechanisms for this would be an actual payment (a fraction of a penny), or giving up processor time (perhaps ten seconds) to solve puzzles. The cost would, they hope, put off potential spammers since sending out a million emails would either take too long or take thousands of pounds.

This idea is fundamentally flawed.

There are legitimate reasons for sending large volumes of emails: universities, organisations, corporations, mailing lists. They all utilise email to a great extend and would be hit in exactly the same place as the spammers. That would simply be unacceptable.

Additionally, processor time is cheap. The spammers buy a few more boxes and let them deal with the backlog of processor time. The cost of this is not prohibitively high.

Nice try though, but it just won&#8217;t work.

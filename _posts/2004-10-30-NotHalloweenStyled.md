I was going to put up a temporary Halloween theme tomorrow, but I&#8217;m rather busy so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to do it properly. The header was going to be along these lines:

![Halloween Solitude Header](/Images/EvilEye.gif)

That was just a quick mock-up I got started, hence the really poor font choice. It&#8217;s the best I&#8217;m going to manage this year, so enjoy. (Also, posting this helps my effort to get more images on this site).

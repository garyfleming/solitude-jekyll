Another year done, so it&#8217;s time to find out what my movie of the year was. As always, [my caveat from earlier years still applies](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2011/12/31/film-fight-2011-finale/ "Film Fight 2011: Finale"): Film Fight is done in a knock-out style and, as such, only picks my favourite film of the year; there are no guarantees about second place.

First, the films that were good but did not win their month:

  * The Hunger Games
  * Jeff, Who Lives At Home
  * The Raid
  * Angel&#8217;s Share
  * Seeking a Friend For the End of the World
  * The Dark Knight Rises
  * Lawless
  * The Man With The Iron Fists
  * Safety Not Guaranteed

Now, the winners:

  * <span style="line-height: 12.149999618530273px">January: J. Edgar</span>
  * February: Carnage
  * March: 21 Jump Street
  * April: The Cabin In The Woods
  * May: Marvel&#8217;s Avengers Assemble
  * June: Prometheus
  * July: Killer Joe
  * August: Ted
  * September: Dredd
  * October: Looper
  * November: End of Watch
  * December: Sightseers

I think it&#8217;s fair to say it&#8217;s been a much weaker showing this year than [last year](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2011/12/31/film-fight-2011-finale/ "Film Fight 2011: Finale"). In 2011, we had a large number of honourable mentions, and the winner&#8217;s list was full of stand-out films, with the toughest final decision in years.

In 2012, we have only 9 honourable mentions (and that&#8217;s after lowering the bar a little), and an extremely uneven winner&#8217;s list. In many other years, Ted, for example, wouldn&#8217;t have won a month.

It&#8217;s fair to say that Joss Whedon is probably the mastermind of the year, with both **Cabin in the Woods** and **Avengers** genuinely surprising; the former with its homage to classic horror, and the latter with a relatively coherent and fun big-budget action film. He&#8217;s helped craft two excellent films there.

Biggest surprise of the year is **21 Jump Street**: a comedy that had absolutely no business being as funny as it was. In some ways, I don&#8217;t want to see it again and find it was only funny because it tickled the right funny bone at the right time, but it was a brilliant film that I didn&#8217;t see coming.

While there were a few moments of **Prometheus** that don&#8217;t stand up to much scrutiny, I think on a whole it did something far better and more intelligently than many gave it credit for. Sure, it wasn&#8217;t Aliens, but neither was it supposed to be. The answers to almost every question I&#8217;ve seen posed is hinted at strongly in the movie, without ever being outright stated. That&#8217;s a degree of subtlety and care that we rarely get in films, let alone large sci-fi films.

There can, however, only be one winner and, for me, that was **Looper**. It&#8217;s an intelligent movie about finding love and the transformative effect that can have. It uses quite a clever sci-fi gimmick to explore that theme which forces an unusual structure, but you&#8217;d be making a mistake to assume that was the whole. It&#8217;s not. This is a film that looks great, misdirects when it needs to, and, above all, tells a very human story. Looper is the Film Fight 2012 winner.

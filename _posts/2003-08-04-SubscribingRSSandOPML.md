A day or two ago, I introduced a very subtle change to this site. Go on, see if you can spot it. Done? For those weak of eye, the <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> button I had is now a &#8220;Sub&#8221; button. What is that and what does it do? Read on.

The [Syndication subscription service](http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/syn-sub/) is a way for sites to help their users subscribe to their <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds, for whatever aggregator they use. By simply clicking on a Sub link, they are taken to a page which lets them pick the aggregator they use and hands off the subscription process to their app; making it easy to subscribe to any feed that uses the process.

So far, so simple. Unfortunately, I offer two RSS feeds (excluding the 3.0 feed). I don&#8217;t want two buttons. So, to get round this, I used the <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> support in the subscription service. Now, if you click on my sub button, you&#8217;ll be able to pick the RSS flavour of your choice and then your aggregator.

At some point, I might add my blogroll to the <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> file, but that&#8217;s for another day.

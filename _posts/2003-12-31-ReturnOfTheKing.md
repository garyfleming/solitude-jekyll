Note: There are spoilers in this review, so look away if you haven&#8217;t seen it already.

If we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, **Return Of The King** is poor, at best. Sure, the giant battles are impressive as always, but even they seem weak compared to the battle at Helm&#8217;s Deep. And the way the battle ended at Minis Tirith? Awful! (&#8220;Oh, and then a bunch of ghosts saved the day.&#8221;)

The acting was atrociously bad. The hobbits, in particular, were painful to listen to.

The ending was also tediously drawn out. I didn&#8217;t think anything would be more dull than the endless walking of **Fellowship Of The Ring**, but the endless ending of Return beat it.

I&#8217;m sure that if you like formulaic Hollywood epics then you&#8217;ll love this. I didn&#8217;t.

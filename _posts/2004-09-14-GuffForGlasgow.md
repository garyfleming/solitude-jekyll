[Derek](http://mrry.co.uk) has just announced [GUFF](http://mrry.co.uk/guff/): an aggregation service for the blogs of any interested Glasgow University student or alumni. If you fall into that category, or just want some damn fine reading (this site included), head on over to GUFF.

Note: I have it on good authority that the acronym expands to something quite obscene.

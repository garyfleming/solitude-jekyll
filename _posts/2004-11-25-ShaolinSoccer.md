Mad, stupid, silly, daft, bizarre, off-colour, odd. All terms that describe **Shaolin Soccer** well.

At it&#8217;s core, Shaolin Soccer is about an idea rather than a story. Someone thought it would be a good idea to mix bullet-time special effects, CG effects and wire-fu with the most basic of comic stories to create a surreal football film. The results are stupid but amusing scenes of balls smashing through players like bowling balls.

Although apparently cut for Western release, the film is still entertaining enough to watch.

I know, I know. You&#8217;re wondering why I haven&#8217;t been filling your lives with long winded articles about obscure attacks, or strange foods or music that no-one else likes. When, you&#8217;re surely thinking, will I find out what film Gary preferred out of the four he saw in January? (It was probably Jarhead by a whisker, to ruin the surprise). The reasons are threefold:

  1. Work. I&#8217;ve been incredibly busy for the last few weeks. There&#8217;s nothing quite like a deadline to kill all creative and expressive urges; it&#8217;s been a case of going to work, coming home, and vegetating.
  2. Going out. To stave off going nuts from the above, I&#8217;ve been going out a hell of a lot, not least of all being [Mr Murray&#8217;s 21st birthday](http://mrry.co.uk/articles/1904/) last weekend. I do implore you to search out the photos from that particular night. Not because of the incriminating pictures of Derek (which are sadly mostly private) but for the fact I look like I&#8217;ve had a stroke incapacitating half of my face in nearly all of them.
  3. Moving. Preparation and pre-moving &#8220;smaller&#8221; items into my nice new flat has been taking up a fair chunk of my free time. I&#8217;ve yet to figure out how to get a drum kit from here to there, but it&#8217;ll be a fun challenge. Semantic web geeks please note that it&#8217;ll mean that my GeoUrl (anyone actually doing anything with those?) will be accurate within 5 miles for the first time!

Sadly, until I get broadband (and a phone line) set up in the new place, the silence will largely continue. See all five of you fine readers at the flatwarming, no doubt.

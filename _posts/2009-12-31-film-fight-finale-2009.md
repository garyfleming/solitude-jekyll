As always [my caveat from previous years still apply](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2008/12/31/film-fight-finale-2008/): Film Fight is a knock-out tournament and, as such, will only select my favourite film. It makes no guarantees about any other place.

First, the non-finalists that deserve a nod:

  * Slumdog Millionaire
  * Milk
  * The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
  * Anvil: The Story of Anvil
  * Monsters Vs. Aliens
  * Star Trek
  * Antichrist
  * Mesrine: Killer Instinct
  * Zombieland
  * Up
  * Where The Wild Things Are

And then the monthly finalists:

  * January: **The Wrestler**
  * February: **Revolutionary Road**
  * March: **Bronson**
  * April: **In The Loop**
  * May: **Synecdoche, New York**
  * June: **The Hangover**
  * July: **Moon**
  * August: **Inglourious Basterds**
  * September: **District 9**
  * October: **Fantastic Mr. Fox**
  * November: **A Serious Man**
  * December: **Nowhere Boy**

Last year, it was very easy to give the title to There Will Be Blood (despite a good effort from No Country For Old Men), but this year the finalists are almost all fantastic films; The Hangover being the only one that slid through in a weak month.

I don&#8217;t know if I could pick a bronze medallist this year, the pack is so tight, but the silver (almost gold) goes to Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s fantastic movie, The Wrestler. It&#8217;s dark, and gritty, and will leave you a little sadder, but only because it&#8217;s such an excellent movie. An absolute must-see.

The winner, however, is **Synecdoche, New York**. Charlie Kaufmann&#8217;s film is so rich with imagery, imagination and an incredible spectrum of emotions that it can&#8217;t help but be an amazing film, in the truest sense of that word. It&#8217;s an instant classic, in my book.

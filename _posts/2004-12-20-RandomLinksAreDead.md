Keen observers of Solitude will have noticed that it has been over a month since the last random links post. Well, that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been working on the all new Random Links sidebar.

From now on, random links will appear in the sidebar (have a look at the left side of the main page). It even has [an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed](http://del.icio.us/rss/solitude "Random links RSS feed for Solitude").

Although the entries in it right now are over a month old (I&#8217;ve been busy), expect a _lot_ of updates.

When someone first brought this to my attention, I thought it was a joke. It&#8217;s not.

Avril Lavigne (Queen of the posers) has covered a song by System Of A Down (Kings of modern metal). Yes, it&#8217;s as bad as it sounds.

I don&#8217;t want to scare people but here is the link [Avril Lavigne &#8211; Chop Suey (Cover)](http://www.crnw46307.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mp3/Avril_Lavigne-Chop_Suey_(System_Of_A_Down_Cover).mp3). I don&#8217;t know how long that link will stay up, so don&#8217;t hassle me if it stops working. Please exercise caution before listening &#8211; it will hurt.

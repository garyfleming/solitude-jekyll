Anyone who uses linux or unix-like systems will, at some point, shoot themselves in the foot with `rm` and `*`. I, after several years of being careful, just joined the glorious ranks of people who messed up by executing the following in my cygwin home directory:

`rm notes *`

The space between notes and * was unintentional. Ah the fun.

As part of a little research into word analysis and how effective it is (a few people can probably guess why I&#8217;m doing said research), I decided to analyse the reasonably predictable musical genre of nu-metal.

From about twenty minutes work came the [Generic Nu Metal Analyser](/Code/GenNuMetal/). Input some lyrics (proper English only &#8211; yes, that means you nu-metallers will have to learn to spell), and check out the results. It seems reasonably capable on the tests I&#8217;ve tried, but will undoubtedly give out false positives and so on. Give it a try though.

I would recommend Linkin Park and Evanescence as particularly generic nu metal songs that get picked up on (although they&#8217;re bound to have a song or two that aren&#8217;t so generic).

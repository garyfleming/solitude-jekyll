[Jackie Chan](http://www.jackie-chan.com/) has always been a favourite <del>actor</del> <ins>martial artist film-star</ins>. He moves with speed, skill and grace. Watching him use his comic fighting style is always a pleasure; watching him act is not.

So his English isn&#8217;t great, but that&#8217;s not the real problem. The worst thing about his films are the stories. No attempt to make a coherent or interesting plot is ever made. Everything is about getting Chan into ridiculous situations so he can fight people with ropes, plates and any other piece of scenery that he can carry at the time. That _is_ a problem.

So, in the vain of [Four Word Film Review](http://www.fwfr.com/): Hire a real writer.

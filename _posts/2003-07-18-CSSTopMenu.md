Another reason why web standards should be promoted: a very nice looking [<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> top menu](http://moronicbajebus.com/playground/cssplay/top-menu/), working in all but <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> based browsers. The best part is how beautifully simple the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> is for it. I can also see CSS3 seriously simplifying the CSS.

Definitely a great tech demo, if nothing else. Via [mezzoblue](http://www.mezzoblue.com/).

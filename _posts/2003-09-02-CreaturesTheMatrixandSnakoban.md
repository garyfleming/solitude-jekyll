Lazy days abound: More random links.

  * **[Interactive Bullet Time demo](http://www.thomasglyn.com/matrix.html)** &#8211; A fun little flash demo, showing off panning around 3d models,
  * **[The Real Underground](http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/realunderground/)** &#8211; See just how warped the London Underground map is with this flash map from the transport museum website,
  * **[The Creatures In My Head](http://creaturesinmyhead.com/)** &#8211; Just plain weird. Odd little monster drawings.
  * **[Snakoban](http://kevan.org/proce55ing/snakoban/)** &#8211; An odd mix of games, but quite addictive. Just don&#8217;t use the X key to cheat.

That&#8217;s enough for today. More to follow.

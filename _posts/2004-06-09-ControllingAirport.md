Apple have announced an interesting new product: the [Airport Express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/). It allows computers with wireless capability to stream music (via an iTunes variant) to remote base stations. These base stations are, in turn, connected to your hi-fi.

Now, while I like the idea and being able to listen to my music collection on my stereo would be fantastic, I&#8217;ve got one question: when I&#8217;m upstairs listening to music via said stereo, how do I control the base station?

It would be easy to create a remote control that told the base station to tell the computer to fast forward/rewind/pause etc. As far as I can tell though, there is no mention of such functionality. I see that as a fundamental flaw. Music with no control? Hmm. A pause button is a minimum requirement in my book.

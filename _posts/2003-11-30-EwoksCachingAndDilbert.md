The links are coming fairly fast these days, so I&#8217;m just going to dump them as soon as I have enough (rather than post them at the end of each week):

  * **[Endor Holocaust](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/holocaust.html)** &#8211; Apparently, the destruction of the second Death Star would&#8217;ve wiped out Endor. Some people have far too much time,
  * **[Caching Web Pages](http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/)** &#8211; I&#8217;ve been meaning to implement this stuff for literally years, but my current (internal) caching system isn&#8217;t good enough. It&#8217;s on my to-do list though,
  * **[Accesskeys and reserved keystrokes](http://wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38)** &#8211; Thinking about making your site more accessible by adding accesskey attributes? The combinations to avoid are fairly comprehensive,
  * **[Polytope Tetris](http://polytopetetris.sourceforge.net/)** &#8211; Ever wondered what 3D Tetris would be like? This program is your chance to experience it; along with 4D, 5D, etc. Imaginary dimensions are fun,
  * **[An Introduction To Quantum Computing](http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~westside/quantum-intro.html)** &#8211; In Quantum Mechanics, you&#8217;ve already had a good read of this,
  * **[Top 10 Internet Fads](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/11/14/173126/56?foo=Top%20Ten%20Internet%20Fads%2011--16)** &#8211; I remember at least some of this. All bad, all the time,
  * **[Dilbert Hole](http://pied.nu/banned/the_Dilbert_Hole/)** &#8211; The rather sick reworked Dilbert comics. Very funny (via [Derek](http://www.mrry.co.uk)).

Expect another batch within a few days (at this rate).

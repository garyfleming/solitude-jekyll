It&#8217;s a new year and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re all stuffed? Time to lose some dead weight.

One of the (many) problems with the digital age is the persistence of data. Put your hand up if you do any of the following:

  * Store every email you have ever received (excluding spam),
  * Never remove anything from your bookmarks,
  * Never update your blogroll (whether adding or removing, displayed or otherwise).

That&#8217;s just a few things. Over the next week, be ruthless with your data. If you honestly haven&#8217;t used it in months, either delete it or archive it on physical media. No point in it stuffing up your computer.

Beyond the wasted space, you&#8217;ll be doing yourself a favour. The more useless data you have, the more noise it produces when trying to find something more useful. Lose those kilo(byte)s now.

Big news: I finally have a comments system. It should work, but if you spot any errors or get erroneous warnings, please let me know (via email or comment).

Rules? Stay vaguely on topic, no spam, no flaming, be nice to each other etc. The usual sort of thing. Oh yeah, and you take responsibility for anything you say: IP&#8217;s are being logged if banning is absolutely necessary, but I doubt it will.

I don&#8217;t expect the comments to get very busy, but knock yourself out. It&#8217;s something I wouldn&#8217;t mind being surprised about.

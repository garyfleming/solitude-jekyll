[Metroblogging](http://www.metroblogging.com/) is a set of location-based collaborative blogs. Bloggers sign up to write about their city, the events and lifestyle therein. A good idea.

It&#8217;s about time we got a Glasgow one. Go over and sign up. Apparently it takes about 10 people from a single city to sign-up to get the city activated. Although I&#8217;m undecided about joining myself (got a lot of other work to do), I&#8217;d like to see a few decent writers from the area join.

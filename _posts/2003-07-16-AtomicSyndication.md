The [Echo Project](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie) finally has a name: Atom. While not my favourite, it&#8217;s not as bad as it could&#8217;ve been. Some of the names on the [Project Name Proposals](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ProjectNameProposals "Proposals for naming the echo project") are truly awful.

Anyway, at least that chapter is over. We can concentrate on defining the format fully.

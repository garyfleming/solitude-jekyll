Now, while file-sharing networks are good and all, I still like finding legitimate sources of music on the internet. While it usually takes a bit of digging (and occassionaly using Streambox to grab streamed audio), there&#8217;s some absolute gold out there.

Take, for example, the [Beggars Banquet Records](http://www.beggars.com/). By following the various artist and audio links, I was able to get some great stuff by amazing bands like [Biffy Clyro](http://www.biffyclyro.com/).

Now, the Beggars site is ok and all but their American counterparts at [Beggar&#8217;s Group, USA](http://www.beggars.com/us/) have a larger selection of artists and audio. Give it a good trawl. I recommend Biffy (again), Mull Historical Society, Mclusky and Super Furry Animals. With all the free stuff available, you&#8217;ll find something of interest.

Only two movies for December&#8230;

First up, **Another Earth** is the kind of movie you never expect and is absolutely one of a kind. It&#8217;s beautiful and tragic, melancholy and hopeful, poignant and bittersweet, and otherworldly (both figuratively and somewhat literally). A mistake results in a horrible accident that ruins the lives of a composer, and a young girl. As their lives come closer together, we see the extent to which fate has not been kind to either, and how there might still be a distant hope. The light sci-fi hook is perfectly situated in the background, neither dominating proceedings nor being entirely irrelevant. It&#8217;s the gun that will be fired, but for the most part the shot is never seen, just the holes it causes. Stunning, and brilliant. A must see film. (See [my Another Earth Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/147464114543923200)).

Finally, **Hugo** is a somewhat disappointing attempt by Martin Scorsese to do a kids film. A few moments set-up as silent movies aside, it lacks the magic and splendour to really pull this off. The pacing is off: the first hour is far too slow to watch as an adult, I can&#8217;t imagine any child sitting through it comfortably. The second half is better, but the pay-off we hope for never really emerges. It&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s not great. Sasha Baron-Cohen manages to inject some character as an awkward station guard, but most of the rest of the cast never really do much. The much-lauded 3D in it adds absolutely nothing; there&#8217;s little in here to give it any impact. A little slow and disappointing, but ultimately okay. (See [my Hugo Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/149956653205291008)).

The winner for December is&#8230; **Another Earth**.

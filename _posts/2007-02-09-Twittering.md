I have signed up to [Twitter](http://twitter.com), partly prompted by [Matt](http://mattgemmell.com)&#8216;s invite, and partly because it seems like a good place to dump those really short thoughts that I think about blogging but then feel guilty about passing them off as real material here. I&#8217;ll integrate it into the sidebar at some point (sometime 2008 at this point), but for now if you want to see it you can find me at <http://twitter.com/garyfleming>, as cunning a name as you might imagine.

If you read this/know me, and already have Twitter, please do add me; I&#8217;m already subscribed to a friends feed.

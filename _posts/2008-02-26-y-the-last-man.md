I&#8217;m not a comic book fan. The genre staple of superheroes fighting each other in every possible combination over childish dialogue and ludicrous lack of continuity really does not appeal. Which is why, after telling some comic-loving friends this, I was so surprised to enjoy their recommendation: [**Y: The Last Man**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man).

It tells the story of Yorick Brown and his pet monkey, starting from the day when every other male on the planet suddenly and violently dies. They&#8217;re left with a world where women have to rebuild. With significant losses to the population of nuclear engineers, politicians, pilots etc, Yorick witnesses a society that is struggling to find meaning while throwing off old gender stereotypes. Meanwhile, he is tasked with finding a cure, accompanied by a brilliant geneticist and a bodyguard.

While some of the sci-fi trappings can seem a little clichÃ©d in synopsis, the excellent writing (provided by [Brian K. Vaughn](http://www.bkv.tv/), who now writes for Lost) is thoughtful and tactful enough that everything that happens seems so inescapable, there&#8217;s no other way that you can conceive of events unfolding.

Unfortunately, the final issue of Y was released just last month, but it&#8217;s better that it was a planned finale (the story was always supposed to end at this point) than it running on longer than the story could have taken.

I&#8217;d advise anyone, particularly those who&#8217;ve taken a snobbish attitude to the comic book form, to read this one book. If you&#8217;re not hooked by the end of the first issue, I can&#8217;t help you; this is the work of genius.

As a post-script, I&#8217;d like to add that it&#8217;s drawn me into some of the less stereotyped comics (I still don&#8217;t like superhero books), including:

  * **Ex Machina** &#8212; Vaughn&#8217;s other series, about a man who becomes a failed vigilante with the help of a mysterious accident,
  * **The Walking Dead** &#8212; A fun, though sometimes drawn-out, story about zombie apocalypse survivors (I have a soft spot for all things zombie),
  * **Buffy Season 8** &#8212; Whedon continuing his brilliant storytelling with a massive increase in scope in terms of what can be achieved.
  * **V for Vendetta** &#8212; The classic 10 part series about revenge, propaganda and change; which makes the film look like a vague embarrassment.

Go, read.

February&#8217;s Film Fight only has two films in it&#8230;

First up is **A Dangerous Method**, the story of how the relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, as well as an inappropriate relationship with a patient, shaped the early days of psychoanalysis. Despite some scenes of manic behaviour from Keira Knightley and Vincent Cassel, the strained friendship at the heart of the film just isn&#8217;t very interesting. Both men are played in an extremely cold and detached manner, reflecting the analytical nature at the heart of their work. While this may be accurate (I don&#8217;t know if it is), it certainly doesn&#8217;t make for interesting viewing. As a whole, the film was largely uneventful and dull. Disappointing. (See [my A Dangerous Method Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/168766848081473537)).

**Carnage** is, at times, amusing and kept interesting by a great cast selection. The four principal actors manage to keep the drama and comedy finally balanced, coming back at each other with the timing that such a play requires. The downside is that the film is very obviously that: a play. By sticking to the conventions of the medium, rather than adapting for film, it has more off-putting stage contrivances than are needed; when the characters start to get drunk within minutes of starting to drink, for example. On a stage, we accept these shortcuts as necessary for putting on the production. On film, they just seem a little lazy. Decent. (See [my Carnage Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/171710624756269056)).

While neither film was great, I think the winner was clearly **Carnage**.

Finally finished this week&#8217;s assignment, so I&#8217;ll be doing a link post later (from home). I couldn&#8217;t wait to post this though.

[Easy <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> drop shadows](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2003/11/14/49/) provides a way of doing decent drop shadows for images, with no redundant markup. Very nice.

Better though is the hilarious picture of the waving cat. I laughed for a good ten minutes.

Given that their is a dearth of pictures of me on my site (with good reason), it&#8217;s with some trepidation that I link to a [photo of me asleep in a lecture](http://iratescotsman.com/images/phonepics/fri-28-11-2003/gary_gmm.jpg). I feel that it shows off my best features. The photo comes from [Matt](http://iratescotsman.com), who sneakily took it while I was in that particular pose.

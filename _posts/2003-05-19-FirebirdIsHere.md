The new version of <del>Phoenix</del> [Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/) has finally been released, and it&#8217;s been a long time coming.

I haven&#8217;t used it yet, but there&#8217;s an extensive list of changes including a new default theme, automatic image re-sizing, smooth scrolling and bookmark context menus (a much needed addition). I just hope that it runs ok on my computer; everything since 0.5 has caused massive drains on the available resources.

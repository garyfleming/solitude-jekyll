Despite early misgivings when hearing about a remake of **Starsky And Hutch** starring Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, it was apparent that everything would be ok from the trailer. This has been confirmed now that the film is in cinemas.

While it is more parody than remake, it does the original series proud; staying loosely true to the two title characters.

Best moment is the scene with **Will Ferrell**. You will never think about dragons the same way again.

It won&#8217;t win any awards, but is an amusing diversion nonetheless.

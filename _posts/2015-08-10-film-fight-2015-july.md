July is traditionally big studio film territory, and that is what we have this year. Four films&#8230;

First up, **Terminator Genisys** is yet another entry in a franchise that should be facing its own Judgement Day. The film immediately sets to ripping apart the timeline to great effect, but quickly squanders its boldness with a plot about an evil Facebook-like company. There are some great set pieces, but they&#8217;re undermined by the clunky exposition and bad acting (Jai Courtney is especially flat). It&#8217;s a better film than its immediate predecessor, but that wouldn&#8217;t be hard. Fun, but not a classic. (See [my Terminator Genisys Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/620256769365942272)).

Seth MacFarlane certainly has his style of comedy and, as in **Ted 2**, it&#8217;s starting to wear a little threadbare. Even if you like his heavily referential/gross-out jokes, here they&#8217;re presented as a loosely connected series of sketches barely held together by the thinnest of plots. There are a few funny moments, but it&#8217;s largely devoid of anything to hold your interest. Avoid this movie, there are many better options. (See [my Ted 2 Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/622703521671065600)).

When **Ant-Man** was first announced, it wasn&#8217;t clear how they&#8217;d fit a character who is more grounded in the golden age of comics, despite his relative latter day importance. This film manages it with a few knowing winks and a fairly unique heist. When it&#8217;s being light and breezy, Ant-Man does very well. The small scale set pieces work surprisingly well, with both action and comedy moments aplenty. It doesn&#8217;t, however, earn a few of the main character beats. The relationship between Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne feels particularly unearned. Light-hearted and fun. (See [my Ant-Man Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/622704009162436608)).

Finally, **Southpaw** is built on every boxing cliche that you can imagine, from the rise-fall-rise structure, to the external struggles (family, drugs), and the training montages. We&#8217;re not getting originality so what are we getting? Well, another jawdropping performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, who couldn&#8217;t look more different than he did in Nightcrawler, and an absolutely gut-wrenching plot involving his daughter. Some of the emotional moments are genuinely affecting, even if some of the relationships are by the book. It&#8217;s a mixed bag, but a solid film. (See [my Southpaw Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/625404418943516672)).

It&#8217;s difficult to pick a winner this month, with a serious film and a fun film that could win other months, but I think **Ant-Man** edges out for the simple fact I&#8217;d watch it again sooner than later.

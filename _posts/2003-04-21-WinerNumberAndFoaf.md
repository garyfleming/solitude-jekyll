After the recent fighting between Dave Winer and a few others over <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, Mark Pilgrim has created the [Winer Number](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/21/whats_your_winer_number.html).

In an effort to spread around this joyous new number to those who have a <acronym title="Friend Of A Friend">FOAF</acronym> profile, I&#8217;ve created the [Winer Number And Extended Winer Number namespace document](http://www.vkps.co.uk/Public/EWN/).

[My own FOAF file](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/foaf.rdf) has been updated accordingly.

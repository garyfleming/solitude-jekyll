I&#8217;ve always been a sucker for spoon-based games (especially the classic card game, Spoons). So when I read this I had to pass it on. From [Yea, but is it art](http://www.yeahbutisitart.com/000035.php):

> Visit their home and then, when leaving, tell them that you&#8217;ve hidden a spoon somewhere in the flat and they have to find it. You could mention that there is a five pound note wrapped around it too&#8230; The missus&#8217; pal then phoned up sounding rather angry and demanding to know where we&#8217;d hidden the spoon. Apparently she&#8217;d broken three nails and killed a plant which was uprooted from its pot in the quest to find the missing spoon.

Read the whole thing, very funny and certainly worth trying.

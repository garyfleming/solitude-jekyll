April was a relatively quiet month for cinema, with only three films viewed.

First up, **Noah** is a heavily dramatised and expanded telling of the story of Noah and the ark, as imagined by Darren Aronofsky. I&#8217;m a fan of much of Aronofsky&#8217;s work (particularly The Wrestler and Black Swan) so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt in tackling what appeared to be a dull subject. I was wrong to do so as there is almost nothing worthwhile in this movie. Visually, it&#8217;s horrendous: bad green screen, awful CG, and colour-graded in the least tactful way you can imagine. The story is overblown, the performances lack any subtlety, and the dialogue is, to a line, atrocious. I cannot begin to imagine why anyone thought this was worth filming having seen a script, but all we can do now is avoid it. One of the worst films in recent years. (See [my Noah Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/455007715744829440)).

A few years ago The Raid was a surprisingly brilliant action movie, full of intricate choreography and a relentless pace, confined to a small tower block. **The Raid 2** sees the scope expand across many more characters and locations, but keeps the essence: a fair plot that is fast moving, but with stunning fights. The stunt set pieces throughout are brilliant. From the prison riot through the nightclub brawl, you won&#8217;t be disappointed. The story itself is a little more convoluted, and told out of order, but don&#8217;t let that throw you too much. Enjoy the action, enjoy the movie. (See [my The Raid 2 Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/457568494234923008)).

Finally, **Calvary** is a strangely dark story about a priest forced to represent the better side of humanity to a largely unseen antagonist (and a cast of other broken people), beyond what he should have to bear. While that sounds high concept, the film is very much grounded in humanity. Shot through with a dark humour, it&#8217;s an oddly affecting film that can be laugh out loud funny one minute and tense the next. From the look through to the performances, this film rarely slips. Exceptionally good. (See [my Calvary Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/459435336016207873)).

The winner, as should be obvious, is **Calvary**; an unexpected gem.

I was looking through the referrer logs just a few minutes ago and found the most interesting entry: someone found me via Google by [searching for &#8220;neds&#8221; and &#8220;noodles&#8221;](http://www.google.com/search?q=neds+noodles). Bizarre.

To be honest, I didn&#8217;t know my site had been indexed by Google at all.

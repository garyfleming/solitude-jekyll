This was originally going to be an essay on the background of [The Matrix](http://www.whatisthematrix.com) (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get round to doing that at some point). But, after I accidently hit the back button in my browser, the entire thing was gone. Disaster!

So, my question is: just how suitable are browsers for working with long pieces of work? Although I don&#8217;t have enough time to really look at this (I spent a fair while doing the deleted essay), it seems to be an important issue. How many people have actually lost work because their browsers didn&#8217;t remember the state of forms after an accidental page traversal? I know it&#8217;s not the first time it&#8217;s happened to me. The backspace button seems particularly prone to allowing this: try to remove some characters whilst getting ready to put in upper cases characters, accidently hit shift and ka-put: An essay gone.

There&#8217;s not even a decent way of saving text midway through typing. You know &#8220;saving&#8221;; that basic and obligatory function in every application since the beginning of back-up media. Sure, we could open a text file and cut-and-paste, but that&#8217;s too much hassle for real people to do it. Also, it also supposes that we expect a disaster. If we expected disaster, then we&#8217;d make sure to backup constantly. Without an easily accessible save function, it&#8217;s not natural to do this. State in other media (pen and paper) is automatically saved for us.

Maybe, I&#8217;m just angry at having lost hard work, but it does seem like the sort of feature all browsers should have.

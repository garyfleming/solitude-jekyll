I was going to post another few film reviews today (the backlog is stopping me from writing anything worthwhile). Instead, I present another selection of random links featuring DRM, caverns and more:

  * **[<acronym title="Gigabyte">GB</acronym>A Unix](http://www.kernelthread.com/publications/gbaunix/)** &#8211; Unix on the Gameboy Advance. File under &#8220;Some people have too much time&#8221;.
  * **[DRM Problems](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/10/DRMprobs)** &#8211; Tim Bray on the trouble with DRM.
  * **[sIFR2.0b](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/09/sifr2-kick-the-tires)** &#8211; The next generation of flash image replacement gets updated.
  * **[Gecko Coloured Scrollbars](http://www.zeit.ca/archive/20040906/)** &#8211; <del>A buggy</del> <ins>An interesting</ins> implementation of coloured scrollbars for mozilla based browsers. Nice idea, <del>but too zapped to work</del> <ins>if only there was a way for it to work on-hover</ins>.
  * **[Secret Paris Cinema](http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Guardian/0,4029,1299449,00.html?=rss)** &#8211; For the one person who hasn&#8217;t heard about this cool discovery yet. Secrets and lies under Paris.
  * **[Emacs Jabber](http://intellectronica.net/emacs-jabber/)** &#8211; Although I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, this is another reason for those who are strong in Emacs to never leave it for another program.
  * **[FireFox Keystrokes](http://www.boxofchocolates.ca/archives/2004/08/25/my-favourite-firefox-keystrokes)** &#8211; Some useful keystrokes in the world&#8217;s best browser. Joy.
  * **[Creative Commons Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/index.jsp)** &#8211; Excellent idea! Search for what you need amongst creative commons licensed projects.
  * **[XKeymacs](http://www.cam.hi-ho.ne.jp/oishi/indexen.html)** &#8211; Use Emacs bindings in other programs. I tend to use them for saving anyway.
  * **[XPath.js](http://mcc.id.au/code/xpathjs/)** &#8211; An XPath processor in javascript.
  * **[<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> Delta Encoding](http://www.robinsonhouse.com/2004/09/14/rss-and-delta-encoding/)** &#8211; Use the recent idea for delta encoding RSS feeds in WordPress. Great idea, few oversights in the implementation. Keep an eye on it though.
  * **[Gmailomatic](http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php)** &#8211; Give away your GMail invites or sign-up to recieve one. I&#8217;ve passed a dozen on so far.
  * **[Springfield Map](http://www.csupomona.edu/~jelerma/springfield/map/)** &#8211; Obsessive map of Springfield, that seems to ignore the episodic inconsistencies. File under &#8220;Some people have too much time&#8221;.
  * **[Politics And The English Language](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm)** &#8211; Fascinating article by George Orwell on the decline of English. Expect more on this article soon.
  * **[Gallina](http://ion.gluch.org.mx/files/Hacks/gallina/)** &#8211; GMail blogging system. People keep finding new ways of using that gig of storage.
  * **[Successful Lisp](http://psg.com/%7Edlamkins/sl/)** &#8211; A slightly poor book on Lisp. I&#8217;ll read more of it when I can be bothered.
  * **[TargetAlert](http://www.bolinfest.com/targetalert/)** &#8211; Fantastic FireFox extension to add icons after <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> files and other strange links.
  * **[Version Control With Subversion](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook-1.0/)** &#8211; Everything you need to know about using subversion, which you should be doing.
  * **[Rome syndication framework](https://rome.dev.java.net/)** &#8211; Making Atom and RSS feeds easy to use in Java. Nice.
  * **[Bandwidth Consumption In RSS](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/rss_bandwidth_c.html)** &#8211; Just lie in your usage of 304. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re shooting someone.
  * **[Word Recognition](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx)** &#8211; Astoundingly good article on word recognition from Microsoft. Long, involving but very worth it.
  * **[Chocolypse Now](http://www.freese-design.com/choc1.htm)** &#8211; And finally, what would happen if Apocalypse Now was melded with Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory? Find out here.

Phew. More film reviews then some real content coming soon.

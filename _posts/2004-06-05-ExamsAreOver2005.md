It&#8217;s been a struggle for the last few months, third year has seen many casualties, but it&#8217;s finally over. My last exam was yesterday and, for the first time since October, I can stop thinking about university. It is a _very_ good feeling.

A few days of celebrations planned before updates here return to normal. Well, they will for about a week before the bigger news (and subsequent downtime around here).

<ins><strong>Update</strong>: Ok, so apparently the year is actually 2004, and not 2005 as the title suggests. But I won&#8217;t have exams next year, so&#8230; quiet.</ins>

<ins><strong>Update 2</strong>:</ins> For anyone who is interested, [Chris](http://www.chris-miller.org/) is hosting [pictures from the final day celebrations](http://www.chris-miller.org/gallery/album16 "Pictures from the 2004 3rd year Glasgow DCS students night out").

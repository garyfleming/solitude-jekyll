It&#8217;s Thursday. It&#8217;s 2pm, and it&#8217;s time for more random links:

  * **[Fight The Spammers](http://feedster.com/blog/archives/51_Time_to_think_about_SpamBack.html)** &#8211; Over at the Feedster blog, there is a dicussion about fighting Spammers at the bandwidth level. Not a bad idea, but costly at the allied end.
  * **[Neural Nets in <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>](http://freebsd.mu/freebsd/archives/000039.html)** &#8211; Someone has created a neural net class in PHP. Astounding stuff, I can&#8217;t wait to see what people do with this.
  * **[Gender Determination](http://www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.html)** &#8211; An algorithm that determines whether someone is male or female by a sample of their writing. It worked on every test I tried, bar one. Of course, that one person was myself. Yes, I write like a girl.
  * **[Zombie Simulator](http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/)** &#8211; <ins><em>FIXED LINK</em></ins>. Easily the coolest link of the day. A java applet that simulates zombies overrunning a city. Lots of emergent behaviour is apparent, and lots of switches to play with. I _will_ be playing with the code for this very soon.

Some big news coming soon&#8230; But probably not for another day or two.

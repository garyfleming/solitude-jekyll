I&#8217;m back from a good weekend at [**T In The Park**](http://www.tinthepark.com) (but the inevitable write up of that will come later &#8211; tomorrow or the next day, maybe). Doesn&#8217;t seem like I&#8217;ve missed a lot.

There&#8217;s some fighting going on over Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s [Winer Watcher](http://diveintomark.org/ww). I can&#8217;t be bothered going into the politics of this thing since I&#8217;m still tired, but it&#8217;s a long running mess that just keeps getting worse.

Elsewhere, [Tom Gilder outlines the ::outline pseudo selector](http://blog.tom.me.uk/2003/07/14/looking_ahead_to_css3_part_1_the_outside_pseudoelement.php). Since <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>3 is still at the working draft stage, I&#8217;d never heard of it before. If it works as advertised, we&#8217;ll all be able to get rid of a _lot_ redundant markup and create better looking sites. That&#8217;s a very good thing.

That&#8217;s about it. I&#8217;m off for a needed rest.

A few rules that recent <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> work has provided:

  1. If what you think you&#8217;re saying works in <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> but not Firefox or Opera, you&#8217;re saying it wrong.
  2. Cascading is tricky, and will likely invoke rule 1 at some point.
  3. CSS Hacks are bound by rule 1.

Bear them in mind.

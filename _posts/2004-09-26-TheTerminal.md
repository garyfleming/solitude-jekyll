**The Terminal** is bad. Very bad. Tom Hanks is pitiful, the story has become generic Hollywood tripe (despite being an interesting premise), and Zeta Jones plays one of the least developed characters of modern times (&#8220;Hi! I&#8217;m simply here to move the plot on very slightly&#8221;).

Utterly without merit.

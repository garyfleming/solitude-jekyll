A long time ago, [I joined the X-Philes](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/05/11/TheXPhiles). I promptly forgot about it, since everything was working well. Recently, I came across another website dicussing various matters about <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and markup: [Anne van Kesteren](http://www.annevankesteren.nl/weblog/).

Among other things, I learned that I could improve my content negotiation. Thanks to [Ben](http://www.stijlstek.nl/ampersand/) for providing the correct user agents, I&#8217;m now one step closer to perfection.

<ins>Update: Because I never really bothered checking old entries before the mime type switch in May, there were a few broken archive pages. That won&#8217;t stand. I went through the entire archive and fixed the few entries that didn&#8217;t work. One step closer&#8230;</ins>

Next step: using an xml stylesheet processing instruction. (Yawn).

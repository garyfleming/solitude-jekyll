February is a lot shorter than [January&#8217;s behemoth edition](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2015/05/26/film-fight-2015-january/) with just 3 films.

First up, **Jupiter Ascending** has some stunning visuals. If you took the Wachowski&#8217;s latest film as a series of isolated moments, it can be absolutely striking. Sadly, those moments are tied together as a film; and a terrible one at that. The plot is nonsensical, largely told in exposition, and with characters for whom it would be a stretch to call them &#8220;sketched&#8221;. Some of the devices and ideas tying the world and action together are beyond dumb, the gravity skates being a particular low point. This film is awful, and I&#8217;d wager a contender for worst film of the year. (See [my Jupiter Ascending Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/565270106692128769)).

**Selma** is a fresh take on the American civil rights movement, focussing on the period Martin Luther King took his campaign to Selma, Alabama. It&#8217;s a fascinating insight into both a small moment of the movement, and does a reasonable job of showing that King was a visionary but not perfect. David Oyelowo puts in a fantastic performance as the lead, demonstrating King&#8217;s well-known oratorial prowess, and some of his frailties. At times the swelling music and sweeping visuals can be a little on the Oscar-bait side, but this is a movie worthy of that grandeur. Very good. (See [my Selma Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/568684692842651648)).

Finally, **Kingsman: The Secret Service** is the kind of big, silly, fun, comic-book chaos that you expect from a Matthew Vaughn film. Sure, it doesn&#8217;t quite make sense, and some of the action is a little more chaotic than clear, but it&#8217;s entertaining. It&#8217;s not going to win any awards, but some films don&#8217;t have to in order to be enjoyable. Good. (See [my Kingsman: The Secret Service Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/568685264396267520)).

Fairly easy but deserving win for **Selma** in February.

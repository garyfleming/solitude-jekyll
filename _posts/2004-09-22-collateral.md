In a move that will shock all right-minded cinema goers, Tom Cruise is bearable in the movie **Collateral**. More than that: he&#8217;s actually pretty damn good. Playing the confident straight forward killer seems to be a role that he was made to play, pulling it off with a degree of style that gets you on his side.

The film itself is the tale of a fairly ordinary cab driver who, upon accepting an all night fare from Cruise, begins becoming more and more unstable as events unfold.

Tightly shot, well paced and Hollywood dialogue at a minimum, Collateral is a very pleasant piece of cinema. Kudos.

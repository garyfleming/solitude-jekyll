I&#8217;m a little curious about something, so this is a post for those who&#8217;ve visited Glasgow or have travelled to the airport in the last few months; if you don&#8217;t fit, bear with me.

As part of my job, I travel to London a reasonable amount. This means that I generally get the Glasgow Flyer bus service (recently taken over and upgraded by [Arriva](http://www.arriva.co.uk/)) from Glasgow city centre direct to the airport, and vice versa. As part of the increase in ticket prices and better service etc., they announced free wi-fi (which I believe is provided by [Moovera Networks](http://www.moovera.com/)).

I&#8217;ve tried this both from my N95 and iPod Touch (which I&#8217;ll talk about at some point in the near future), and I get the same result on every trip: I can connect to the router just fine (i.e. the devices can talk to the buses equipment), but if I try to request ANYTHING from the internet it just does not work. It looks to me like the outgoing connection to the internet just doesn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ve tried numerous different sites that don&#8217;t go down (Google, IMDB etc) and I&#8217;ve never made a successful request.

Has anyone else had this working? If so, what were you doing? Am I missing something really basic here? I&#8217;d be interested in finding out.

UPDATE: Moovera have [replied in the comments](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2008/02/28/glasgow-flyer-wifi/#C-17241), seems to be a known and now-fixed issue. Excellent.

Yes, it&#8217;s been quiet here for the last few days. A full random link post will follow shortly (and it will be rather large), but for now I&#8217;d like to draw attention to [an interview with the <acronym title="Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy">HHGG</acronym> movie writer]().

Although, like many fans of the excellent Douglas Adams books, I was apprehensive about the film possibilities, this interview quashes all fears. The film looks like it is in safe hands.

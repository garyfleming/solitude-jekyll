I&#8217;ve partially fixed the problems outlined in [the article, &#8220;Failure&#8221;](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030223230232). Unfortunately a new one has creeped up: I can&#8217;t delete or edit any files at all. The last post I made was a test to check if everything was working. I can&#8217;t get rid of it. Very frustrating.

The changes that work (hopefully) are:

  * The <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> has moved. To find it, either use standard auto-discovery or click the orange <acronym title="eXtensible Mark-up Language">XML</acronym> button on the navigation bar. This was done to facilitate future changes that are in motion,
  * I finally added an [accessibility statement](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/AccessibilityStatement.php) to the site. This has been done for a long time but I didn&#8217;t have a link to it. Read at your leisure,
  * The archives still work but, since updating, are a bit twitchy. If you notice anything odd, [notify me](mailto:solitude@vkps.co.uk).

I&#8217;m also going to be gone for a few days; probably Tuesday before any more updates are available. The next PHP challenge should go live around then too.

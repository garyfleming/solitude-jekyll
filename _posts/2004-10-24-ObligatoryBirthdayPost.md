[A year on](/Archives/2003/10/24/RememberAutumnLeaves "My birthday post in 2003") from my last birthday (as tends to be the case with these events) and a lot has changed. Some good, some bad, some just plain odd.

I look different, I act differently and I feel changed.

For the first time in three years, I&#8217;m writing. A lot. While the continued work load at university has cramped this significantly, I&#8217;m still writing when I get a chance. Most of it is garbage, and much of it ends up getting deleted. The point is that I got over a three year writer&#8217;s block and it feels good.

A lot feels good these days. 21, an interesting age, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a good year.

This is, according to WordPress, the 600th post I&#8217;ve made since I started Solitude way back in January 2003. A lot of time has passed, lot of changes, and lot of silly things said (as well as the odd gem). I did consider going back through the entire archive and pointing out all the places I disagree with myself, but I figure that could take a while.

No grand promises about posting more, or better, or anything like that; just a marker to say we&#8217;re still going.

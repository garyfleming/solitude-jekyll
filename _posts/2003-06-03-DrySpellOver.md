Updates should be back to normal now. Well, at least until next week. I&#8217;ve just finished this weeks batch of exams (for more information on those, I suggest reading the round-ups on [Derek&#8217;s site](http://www.mrry.co.uk), although I thought Algorithmic Foundations was much harder than he apparently did), and don&#8217;t have any more until next week &#8211; which is the last block.

So, for at least a week, normality will return. That is all.

This weeks random links:

  * **[Throw Rocks At Boys](http://www.davidandgoliathtees.com/new/games/throwrocks.html)** &#8211; A charming little flash game where you throw rocks&#8230; at boys.
  * **[<acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> HTTP Headers](http://www.blunck.info/iehttpheaders.html)** &#8211; Like Live Headers, but for a crap browser.
  * **[Plucene](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/02/19/plucene.html)** &#8211; A perl port of Lucene, the java indexing project.
  * **[Regex For <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s](http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/url2.html)** &#8211; A mammoth regex that will parse almost any kind of url. Complex stuff.
  * **[Anime Cartoon](http://www.generyx.de/anime.gif)** &#8211; An odd little gif animation.
  * **[Link Bar](http://www.draig.de/LinkBar/index.en.html)** &#8211; Another workaround for Internet Explorer&#8217;s lackings, a link bar. Comes as standard on other browsers.
  * **[Sharp Edges](http://www.rcsheets.net/images/sharp_edges)** &#8211; Funny image.
  * **[Yahoo Vs Google](http://www.langreiter.com/exec/yahoo-vs-google.html)** &#8211; Visualisation of search engine overlap and differences.
  * **[Bright Fish](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4478)** &#8211; Who knew that MP3s are allowed to be tagged with &#8220;a bright coloured fish&#8221;? It&#8217;s in the spec.
  * **[LinkFader](http://projects.impenetrable.org/linkfader/)** &#8211; A link fader script that seems to be markup friendly. Nice.
  * **[Things My Maths Teacher Did](http://www.willamette.edu/~jtdavis/teacher/teacher.html)** &#8211; Some absolutely bizarre behaviour from a teacher.
  * **[Ninja Golf](http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/ninjagolf/)** &#8211; A great idea, whether it is a spoof or not.
  * **[Pikasso](http://www.oddmusic.com/gallery/om23350.html)** &#8211; Imagine the rocking you could do on this bad boy.
  * **[The Viagra Prank](http://www.zug.com/pranks/viagra/index.html)** &#8211; Taking a viagra and then going to church. Bad idea, but funny.

That&#8217;s it for today.

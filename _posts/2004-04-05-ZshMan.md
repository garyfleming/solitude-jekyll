For no real reason I was looking at the ZSh man page and found this gem of paragraph:

> A userguide is currently in preparation. It is intended to complement the manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be cabbalistic, hierographic and, or downright mystifying (for example, the word &#8216;heirographic&#8217; does not exist).

Something about self-referencing humour that makes the English geek in me smile.

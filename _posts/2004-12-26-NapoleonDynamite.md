It is not often that you leave a film unsure whether you liked what you saw or not. Generally you can tell by the amount of snoring or head-shaking at plot points that you do not like it. It was odd, then, that **Napoleon Dynamite** left a fairly empty feeling inside. It is funny, but also embarrasing.

The eponymous character is a loser, not the sort of loser who is just non-conformant like in so many US high school films, a genuinely odd loser. His family are stranger, and it can be very uncomfortable to watch them interact.

Just like the film, I&#8217;m not sure where to go with this. It&#8217;s odd, but not necessarily good or bad.

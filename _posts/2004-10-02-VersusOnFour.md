You may remember that I rather liked Japanese ultra-violent flick [Versus](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2004/08/17/Versus). For the benefit of anyone in the UK with access to cable, satellite or pay-to-view TV, FilmFour are showing it at midnight tonight (or first thing tomorrow morning for those pedants out there). It&#8217;s also Freeview weekend on FilmFour, so you don&#8217;t have to be a subscriber. Excellent!

Worth watching.

Apparently, the [web is grey](http://drunkmenworkhere.org/203.php?report=1). After averaging the colours of 3000 or more sites using the [temporary url2png service](http://drunkmen.xs4all.nl/url2png.php), the output colour is #9c9c9c; a pretty bog-standard grey.

It&#8217;s not really that surprising. The majority of the web uses black text on a white background, with the various other colours pulling the colour average up towards the black end of the scale (the red, green and blue averaging out to a grey).

Still, an odd piece of trivia that we&#8217;re bound to remember.

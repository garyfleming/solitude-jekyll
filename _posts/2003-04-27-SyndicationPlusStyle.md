I&#8217;ve been messing around with <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> 2.0 feeds a bit lately. I thought it was about time I added one myself. So, I had a look at the feed [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net) has and took what I needed.

Then I got to thinking: we have an <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> body for content in the feed, so why not use it as we would in any other web page? After a little messing around, I added some <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> rules and now have a feed that&#8217;s smarter (looking) than your average feed.

I give you my [RSS 2.0 feed](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Syndication/RSS2.xml).

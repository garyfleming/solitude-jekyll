A quick message to say that Solitude will largely disappear for the next two weeks or so. Coincidentally, that&#8217;s how long I&#8217;ve got to finish my final year project (something about efficient plagiarism detection) which I&#8217;m sure will get a post or so here in the future.

The odd post may appear and [random links](http://del.icio.us/solitude "Links from Solitude") certainly will continue.

Some new toys will appear when I return, as well as documentation and source for the recently updated [Acto<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/ActoRss/), which provides RSS feeds for most actors, producers and directors (it is now more accurate in selecting the correct actor).

Back in a few.

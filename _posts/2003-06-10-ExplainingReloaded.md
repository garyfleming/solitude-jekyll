Right, this _will_ be the last **Matrix** post in a long time. This time some guy is trying to [explain The Matrix Reloaded](http://webpages.charter.net/btakle/matrix_reloaded.html).

I haven&#8217;t read the whole thing yet but, despite the craziness in places, it makes a lot of sense. Worth a read.

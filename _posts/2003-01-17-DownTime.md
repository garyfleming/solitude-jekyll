I tried to update this site today, but to no avail. It seems that my hosts are down again. I don&#8217;t mind the odd bit of downtime, I really don&#8217;t, but this is the second time in as many weeks. I need to find a new host.

Anyway, today&#8217;s updates will be made offline and then uploaded at a later date. Such are the benefits of having a robust, database-free <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> offline: synchronising is cheap and easy (most modern <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> clients can do this for you), server downtime doesn&#8217;t limit productivity, and you have somewhere to rant.

It should also be mentioned that the local copy of my <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>, Finetto, is more advanced than the online copy since it has all the latest updates I&#8217;m making.

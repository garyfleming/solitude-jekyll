I signed up for [BlogShares](http://www.blogshares.com) the other day just to try it out. You might have noticed a link about it at the bottom of this page. Or not. I&#8217;m quite enjoying the simulation of it all; everything everyone does in the blogsphere, whether they&#8217;re part of the game or not, affects everything else. Connectivity at its finest.

In one proper day of playing, I&#8217;ve managed to almost triple my money. Although that&#8217;s nothing to the hardcore traders, &#8221;m quite proud.

Oh, and [Simon](http://simon.incutio.com) , I&#8217;m your biggest share-holder at the moment, so get those links going!

Via [Jack Mottram](http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/mt/) comes news of the [The Publisher](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4507). Leveraging the offer made by [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/) to host any CC-licensed audio or video files, the Publisher is a tool to upload such files and provides a link to give people to download.

This has all the signs of a _good thing_:

  * Free.
  * Easy.
  * Not likely to go down anytime soon (although the archive does get stressed at times).
  * No legal or moral issues (yeah, big problem there).

I&#8217;ve been getting more and more impressed by Archive.org&#8217;s contribution to the net. The free movie archive is good, then the legal bootleg archive (which I recently noticed features shows by Texan alt rockers And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead&#8230; reason in itself to visit) and now this. Good stuff.

> &#8230;the harm was done: the topic became known as &#8220;computer science&#8221;&#8212;which, actually, is like referring to surgery as &#8220;knife science&#8221; &#8212; and it was firmly implanted in people&#8217;s minds that computing science is about machines and their peripheral equipment.

An excellent quote by Edsger Dijkstra. Most computing science is about design: spending a long time planning things, letting ideas grow, knowing where to cut out the unnecessary, seeing the woods for the trees, and trying to do all this an as elegant a manner as possible.

It is always a bold move to remake a classic cult film. Some would say it is a pointless move; trying to beat something that is loved by a dedicated group of fans is certainly an unenviable task. It was with this in mind that I saw **Texas Chainsaw Massacre**.

It is, in a word, laughable.

Maybe I&#8217;m overly desensitized to these things, but it wasn&#8217;t particularly scary or gruesome. It tried to be twisted, it tried to be sick, it failed on both accounts.

Not worth seeing. Find yourself a cheap copy of the original. It&#8217;s an order of magnitude better.

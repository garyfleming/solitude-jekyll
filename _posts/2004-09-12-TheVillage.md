**The Village** suffers in several ways inherent to M. Night Shyamalan&#8217;s technique. The cold, distant shots; the abuse of misdirection in his writing (it&#8217;s more cunning when you put everything in plain sight, rather than just hint at it); and the trite twists.

Despite this, The Village is fairly good. Well, by fairly good, I mean in perspective of his recent efforts (let&#8217;s not discuss **Signs**). Sure, the main twist is obvious, but the film is still a solid piece of storytelling. While it won&#8217;t win any awards (well, it probably has already), it&#8217;s reasonably entertaining.

Erik Benson is saying some very interesting things about [self-explanatory objects](http://www.erikbenson.com/entries/2004/05/10/a_selfexplanatory_object.html) and context, by extension.

Is it possible to remove an item from context, away from social convention and understanding? To truly understand something you have to be able to contextualise it. The untrained ear might be forgiven for thinking that heavy music is just noise. Those more familiar with a band&#8217;s influences find it easier to pick out melody, inflection, and more significant technical achievements (tapping a cow bell every 16 beats, while still hammering away elsewhere, say).

Context is key to all understanding and enjoyment. There was a study many years ago to do with the influence of music on film. They played a really serious scene (violently so) and showed audiences it with dramatic music and then more comical music over the top. From the context of the music, audiences were either highly uncomfortable or laughing heavily. What does that say to you?

A television breaks in a quiet town. Relatively speaking, this means nothing. It&#8217;s not a profound cosmic event. It won&#8217;t mean anything to most people. Bruce isn&#8217;t most people. Bruce is a touch mad. Not in a scary or clinical way though. He&#8217;s just eccentric at times, in a charming rather than &#8220;let&#8217;s cross the street away from him lest he tries to borrow our shoe laces&#8221; kind of way.

Having been in the television repair business in the same spot for decades, he knows a thing or two about televisions too. In fact, he knows pretty much everything there is to know. Got a problem? Phone him up. If he needs to come out to repair it (perhaps you&#8217;re too infirm to bring it to him), you&#8217;ll likely hear his never-faltering battlecry of &#8220;Never fear, Bruce is here&#8221; followed by an analysis of the TV based on the symptoms (without looking at) which is invariably correct.

Go to his shop, conveniently located just outside the quiet town&#8217;s central area, and you&#8217;re in for a treat. You&#8217;ll get explanations of how to quickly shunt the mask in your TV to fix discolouration, how you can fix your VCR problems with a hair dryer, or one of another dozen seemingly crazy solutions that always work and you won&#8217;t be charged to hear. It&#8217;s surprising that he has been open as long as he has with that kind of generosity.

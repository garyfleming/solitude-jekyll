So, as of the publishing date of this piece, Solitude will have been around and active for six years. It seems like a long time. Going back and looking over the first few entries is, as one might expect, cringe-inducing.

There&#8217;s the [very first post](/Archives/2003/01/10/NewSiteSoon/) (which promised the now long-defunct main VKPS site would be back soon &#8211; HA!) and [first real update](/Archives/2003/01/11/RealConnections/) about Geolocation (which hasn&#8217;t really done much of any use, though we&#8217;ll see if [Geode](http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/10/introducing-geode/) changes that), and the first film review (for [The Tuxedo](/Archives/2003/01/28/TheTuxedo/)), and even the first first recipe (I remember how bad that [omlette](/Archives/2003/01/17/Omlette/) was, it was all shell).

Even though my post rate has dropped over the years, I hope that Solitude or a successor will still be here in another six years, to give me pleasant memories to wince over.

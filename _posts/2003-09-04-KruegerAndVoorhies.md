With a title like **[Freddy Vs Jason](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0329101/)**, it was never going to be a classic. As should be expected, the acting is awful and the premise is weak at best. You can pretty much guess everything else about it.

To be honest, though, I&#8217;m not entirely sure how much I disliked this film (I did dislike it though). I had such low expectations of it that it easily managed to surpass them; being watchable even if mostly terrible. So, while it&#8217;s about as scary as a kitten in a cotton wool jacket, it&#8217;s not as bad as you might think. Go see it? Still no.

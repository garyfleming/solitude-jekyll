A slightly extended random link post this week, it&#8217;s just been building up over the last few days:

  * **[Cheezwiz, the game](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/CheezWiz.html)** &#8211; The game where you secretly swap the meaning of two words for some laughs. Read the examples for a better explanation,
  * **[Mid Pass Filter](http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/midpass.html)** &#8211; A way to target CSS directly at the broken box model of <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> 5. Very handy for developers,
  * **[Shades Of Gray](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001053)** &#8211; Aaron Swartz discusses what should be done when you know someone is lying, taking in the always fun [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com) and George Bush,
  * **[Absurd Church claims](http://www.guardian.co.uk/aids/story/0,7369,1059068,00.html)** &#8211; Yes, the Catholic Church are claiming that condoms don&#8217;t stop AIDs, despite various health authorities saying they&#8217;re wrong. Do the Church fight back with reason and evidence? Course not. &#8220;They are wrong about that&#8230; this is an easily recognisable fact.&#8221; Big hand waving, we like it,
  * **[mod accessibility](http://apache.webthing.com/mod_accessibility/)** &#8211; An Apache model to help out with various accessibility issues. Nice,
  * **[Pricelessware](http://www.pricelessware.org/2003/about2003PL.htm)** &#8211; Windows freeware repository (Via [Mark Pilgrim](http://www.diveintomark.org)),
  * **[strtotime](http://uk.php.net/strtotime)** &#8211; Not quite the function I hoped for, but still a very useful one. <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> discovery of the week,
  * **[Galaxy far, far away](http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/blog/index.php/personal/in_a_galaxy_far_far_away.html)** &#8211; Matt is pointing to a rather amazing rendition of the Star Wars theme. You have to hear it, people should not be able to reproduce music that well.

And that&#8217;s your lot for the day.

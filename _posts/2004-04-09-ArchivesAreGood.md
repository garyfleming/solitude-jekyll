Partly via [Waxy.org](http://www.waxy.org) comes news that [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org) has some excellent new features (or maybe this is me just noticing them).

First up is the new movie archive featuring such classics as [Night Of The Living Dead](http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=feature_films&collectionid=night_of_the_living_dead), to download for free. Most of the films are extremely old, but the price is right.

Also excellent is the new [Live Music Archive](http://www.archive.org/audio/etree.php), featuring full live sets in the shorten format. Although I hadn&#8217;t heard of most of the bands, it has some hidden gems like 19 Tenacious D sets. For free. Take that record industry fools.

I had previously never heard of the shorten format, but do a quick google search for it and everything you need to know about listening to, creating and decompressing .shn files becomes available.

Last year I was a [young pup at 23](/Archives/2006/10/24/ThisIs23/). As of today, I&#8217;m an old and enlightened 24 year old \*COUGH\*.

Being 24 is a lot like the TV show of the same name: you&#8217;re an untouchable badass willing to do anything to protect your ideals, and there any number of terrorists willing to launch an attack on you within a few seconds of the hour mark (pro tip: if it&#8217;s a couple of seconds to the hour, maybe cover your head to be safe). Also, your daughter is probably fairly crap at not being kidnapped.

Anyway, the changes this year have been, in many ways, subtle. I&#8217;m still working for the same BigCo (in a different job), most of my circumstances are pretty much the same (aside from a few personal items), and that&#8217;s just fine with me; everything is going pretty great.

Here&#8217;s to another year of this.

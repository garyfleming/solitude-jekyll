I&#8217;m a little sad to say this but for the first time since I started doing Film Fight, and indeed for the first time since I started reviewing films on here, I haven&#8217;t actually been to the cinema this month. There&#8217;s been a dearth of quality looking films and I simply haven&#8217;t made it along to even the few &#8220;maybe ok&#8221; stragglers.

So this month the winner is&#8230;. nothing at all.

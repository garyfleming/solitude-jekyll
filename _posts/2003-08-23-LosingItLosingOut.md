Have you ever been really great at something, anything? I don&#8217;t mean ok, or better than average, I mean really good. It&#8217;s a great feeling. Every bit of practice, all the blood and sweat that went into getting that good, is worth it in the end. You feel vindicated by having a new skill.

Have you then, for whatever reason, stopped doing this thing you were great at (notice the past tense there, it&#8217;s lucidly foreboding)? You just haven&#8217;t done it in a few years. Maybe you were bored with it, had other commitments, or a vital piece of equipment was no longer available. These things happen, and moving on is the right thing to do.

So, after your &#8220;away&#8221; spell, you come back to your skill because the situation is now like it was when you started it; your stars in alignment, your interest peaked, whatever. And then the inevitable part: you can&#8217;t do it anymore. The years of practice forgotton, the sweat gone, and the clumsiness aparrent for all to see.

It&#8217;s depressing, and embarassing. You _know_ you could do it, you have evidence to prove it, but you can&#8217;t do it now. In time, you could get it back. But after the initial shock, do you really want to go back through the rigour of training again? That&#8217;s up to you, and I can offer no advice either way.

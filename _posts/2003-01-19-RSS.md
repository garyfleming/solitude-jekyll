You might have noticed a tiny <span class="rssbutton">xml</span> button appear on the navigation bar. Those in the know will, well, know that it&#8217;s an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> button. The front page of this site is now available in the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> format for those that have aggregators. Don&#8217;t say I&#8217;m not good to you.

There&#8217;s never enough time in the day. I did plan on updating this site properly today, but after picking up the gamecube pad, I ended up playing **Zelda: Wind Waker** for far too long.

The game is just so engrossing: beautiful graphics, an interesting story, puzzles which infuriate until you realise you&#8217;re being an idiot, hundreds of fun little sub-games, treasure hunts, auctions; the list is endless. I spent 2 and a half hours doing stuff which didn&#8217;t really contribute to the story, but made great diversions. Windfall island has been well and truly owned.

With exams coming up, how do I avoid visual crack like this? <ins>P.S. Gouging my eyes out is not an option.</ins>

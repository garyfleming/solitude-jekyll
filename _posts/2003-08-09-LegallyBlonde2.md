No funny heading. It doesn&#8217;t deserve one. Things I learned whilst watching **Legally Blonde 2**:

  * You can&#8217;t will yourself into a coma,
  * You really can get away with passing off excrement as art (perhaps a bit strong),
  * I really need to trust my instincts when getting dragged to see films: if you think it looks dire before seeing it, chances are you&#8217;re right,
  * Maxibons are tasty.

Ok, so I&#8217;ve known the last one for quite some time, but the rest are true.

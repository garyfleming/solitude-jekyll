A few days ago, I spotted a bug in the new [Feedster bot](http://feedster.com/blog/archives/116_Feature_1__The_FeedBot_or_Daddy_do_I_have_to_use_a_web_browser__No_son.html), just before it made a proper release. I didn&#8217;t think anything of it at the time. Later, I noticed I had been thanked on the bots help page. Kinda odd, for having not really done anything.

[Scott (of Feedster) disagrees](http://feedster.com/blog/archives/121_But_I_Didnt_Do_Anything_.html). Fair enough, I&#8217;m just glad to have a new toy to play with.

Today, I noticed a (fatal) bug in the [UGC <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> Feed Creator](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/UgcRss/). Ampersands weren&#8217;t being properly escaped. It&#8217;s now been fixed.

Bugs, like buses, come in threes. First person to spot the last one gets a (theoretical) prize.

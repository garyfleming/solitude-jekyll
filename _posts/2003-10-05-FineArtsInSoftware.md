The University of Illinois is thinking about starting a [Master of Fine Arts in Software](http://www.dreamsongs.com/MFASoftware.html) (via [Simon](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/10/03/mfaInSoftware)). It seems like a very interesting angle to study computing from (certainly more so than the cludge of mathematical approaches and rote learning that is so common these days).

People have to accept that, like any creative form, coding is an art. There&#8217;s certainly a lot of code that isn&#8217;t art, just as there is art which isn&#8217;t particularly artistic. Elegant solutions, engaging ideas, inspiring work; these are some of the defining characteristics of art. They all apply to software.

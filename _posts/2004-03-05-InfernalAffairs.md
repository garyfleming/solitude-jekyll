You have to wonder how much has been lost in translation in films like **Infernal Affairs**. The direction is stylish but functional, the plot good, but the dialogue seems very basic; like the mangled simplification of a poor translation.

The film does not suffer too much for this: the story is still comprehensible, even if it does have a few bizarre subplots (was the psychiatrist really necessary?).

Worth seeing.

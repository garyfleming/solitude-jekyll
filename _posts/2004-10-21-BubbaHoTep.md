With a plot involving a decrepit Elvis, a black JFK in a wheelchair, and protecting a retirement home from an evil soul-sucking mummy preying on the residents, **Bubba Ho-Tep** isn&#8217;t your typical film. Starring the legendary Bruce Campbell this film is entertaining from the first moody line right through to the great, if predictable, ending.

Although it clearly revels in the surreal setting and characters, Bubba is also very grounded; having a lot to say about growing old and getting wise, preparing for the future and dealing with uncertainty. Damn near poignant if it wasn&#8217;t interrupted by mummy crap jokes.

All the roles are excellently cast. You soon won&#8217;t be questioning that Elvis is alive and well (apart from _that_ wart).

Funny, smart, crazy. Easily one of the best films of the year.

Some of you might have noticed that certain parts of the site (namely, the archives) have been inaccessible for the last few days, and others haven&#8217;t been updated (namely, the whole thing). Why, you ask? I&#8217;ve been talking about updating the back-end of the site a lot recently. On Friday I finally got the changes finished on the offline version of the site. One merge later with the online version and disaster. Here&#8217;s what went wrong:

  1. My devbox (being Windows based) has no real understanding of file permissions. My online box (which runs on Linux) does. By scripting for the former, I failed to anticipate the &#8220;File Permission Denied&#8221; messages that my online site (rightly) gave me,
  2. The archives. I completely forget to change the code for them, so it choked the minute the update went live. Doh,
  3. The <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed died, inexplicably. It should be working again (I&#8217;ll know when this update goes online).

I had planned to fix all of this over the weekend, but a cold virus had other ideas. Until I get time to really thing about the problems facing the updated back-end, I thought it would be best to just switch to a back-up I made minutes before I made the change. (ALWAYS back-up before a big change, stuff like this is bound to happen).

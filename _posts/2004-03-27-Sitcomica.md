Tonight, a nation, once great, was left shamed in public. The last shreds of decency and morality gone in a turbulent public vote. Surely, only chaos can now follow.

I am, of course, referring to the outcome of the Best British Sitcom Of All Time. The outstanding genius of **Blackadder** just came in second to the great, but miniscule by comparision, **Only Fools And Horses**. How will people be able to sleep tonight?

Oh well, at least **The Vicar Of Dibley** didn&#8217;t win. How that got into the top ten, never mind third place, is beyond me.

I came across [Ryochiji&#8217;s](http://blogs.iloha.net/ryochiji/ "Ryochiji's Blog") interesting new blog-matching site called, surprisingly, [BlogMatcher](http://blogmatcher.com/) (via [mrry](http://www.mrry.co.uk/)). It indexes blogs that ping [weblogs.com](http://www.weblogs.com) and finds similarity in links. You, the imaginary user, then come along and give it a blog to find matches for. It then provides you with a list of similar sites.

Most of [my BlogMatched sites](http://blogmatcher.com/j.php?url1=http%3A%2F%2Fsolitude.vkps.co.uk) focus on <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and other similar issues; not surprisingly, considering how tired I am of writing that acronym &#8211; really need to automate that. There are a few entries on random stuff ([Halle Berry](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030506232303 "Review of X-men 2"), [Dreamcatcher](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030503234319), etc) as well.

Also, I hate [BlogShares](http://www.blogshares.com). I started playing a month or two ago for 10-15 minutes a day; slowly amassing money. And then I bought into [FSP 1.1](http://omor.com/b/). Shares bought at $15.63 have dropped to $0.81, scrubbing $800 from my pockets. DAMMIT! Oh well, I made a grand on another site overnight so karma balanced.

Recently, I&#8217;ve been reading about [Uberman&#8217;s Sleep Schedule](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=892542) &#8211; a way of hot-wiring your brain into allowing 2 hours sleep a day. I don&#8217;t think I could make it work just now (where could I sleep at university every 4 hours?), but might experiment a bit during the summer.

There was more, but it&#8217;s gone for now.

[**Buffalo Soldiers**](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0252299) begins a bit like a very dark version of Sergeant Bilko: soldiers bored in the army getting up to various scams behind the backs of the incompetent commander, until someone new arrives and tries to catch them. But with drugs, guns and industrial cleaner replacing the odd poker game.

It&#8217;s funny, and well-paced, with only a very discontinuities.

The biggest problem, as with many modern films, is the insistence on a happy ending. There&#8217;s a very clear, obvious and satisfying ending that gets stepped over to provide that Hollywood happiness that seems to be essential to film makers these days. The film suffers for it.

July was a decent month, 3 films, all worthwhile in their own way.

**Ice Age 3** is, inevitably, an also-ran in the animated movie race. It doesn&#8217;t come from Pixar so is never going to be as great as something like Up (wait for the October Film Fight for that one). It is, however, a good fun film. Sure, the plot isn&#8217;t very deep, but it&#8217;s a kids film. It&#8217;s silly, and funny, and has some surprising risque jokes. Simon Pegg is great as crazed adventurer, Buck, and the rest of the cast build the franchise just a little more. Good and simple humour. (See [my Ice Age 3 Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/2483569276)).

It&#8217;s hard to say whether Sascha Baron Cohen has any shame or limits. In every one of his projects, he goes further and further. **Bruno** is no exception. His very camp, Austrian fashion designer runs amok through US talk shows, the middle east, and the deep south; offending everywhere he goes. The laughs are inconsistent, but when they come they&#8217;re often huge. It&#8217;s obviously not for the easily offended, but for those that like humour that makes them very uncomfortable, this shows the master at work. (See [my Bruno Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/2587785654)).

Finally, **Moon** is an interesting movie. It&#8217;s not The Shining in space, which is what I expected, but it does evoke the cold and desolate atmosphere even better than that movie. Sam Rockwell plays a harvester operator at the end of a three-year stint on the moon, when things start to go wrong. The isolation has made him lonely, to the point he&#8217;s seeing people on the surface. The mystery deepens when he realises he might not be as mad as he first thinks. The structure is a little slow, but the off-beat way scenes play out make it fairly compelling. Early on, it&#8217;s hard to tell whether we&#8217;re seeing delusions or genuine events, firmly planting us in the reality of the film. A convincing debut from Duncan Jones. Definitely see.

The winner for July is **Moon**, for it&#8217;s stark atmosphere and interesting play with the medium.

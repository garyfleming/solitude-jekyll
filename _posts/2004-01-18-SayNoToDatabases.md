Having recently read [Why I Don&#8217;t Like Databases](http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/17/databases), I find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with [Stuart](http://www.kryogenix.org).

Further to his second point on a databases good points (the power of <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym>), I don&#8217;t think that is necessarily a clear advantage now that XPath is available. Given that XPath can run across any <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> file, it&#8217;s easy to imagine XML files in a filesystem that can be queried with as much power as SQL.

As time goes on, I hope to see the differences between database backends and filesystem backends become more transparent. There&#8217;s little reason for it not to happen, and plenty to gain from it.

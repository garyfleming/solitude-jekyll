I&#8217;ll say it up front: **Kill Bill** is a damn good film. Tongue in cheek direction coupled with over the top kung fu scenes conspire to make you laugh and look away simultaneously; disgusted by the gratuitous amount of decapitations, yet undeniably amused by it.

And no, it wasn&#8217;t only my occasionally sick mind that thought so (anyone been around long enough to remember the rabbits? Thought not.)

The acting, dialogue and plot are suitably cheesey, the ending perfectly done, and the anime section breathtakingly done. Very bloody, yet artistic.

A definite must see film, certainly one of this year&#8217;s highlights.

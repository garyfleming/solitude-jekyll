If you&#8217;ve been here before (for any of the sites 2-3 week existence), you&#8217;ll have noticed a bit of a change. To be honest it was necessary. The last design took all of 2 hours to mark-up and design; hence it looked a bit shit.

This time I&#8217;ve spent a bit more time coming up with a design (probably about an hour &#8211; no major mark-up changes to bog me down) and had an idea of what I wanted the site to look like.

The idea was to go for a very minimalist look: clean solid blocks of colour, made slightly uneven by various techniques. Only 1 main colour was used, on top of the black and white (with a few other colours used in minor places), to really pull the visual design together.

Now, those of you using standards compliant browsers will see a little bit more than those using non-standards compliant browsers. It&#8217;s nothing essential (that would be bad for accessibility) but it does enhance the site. For an example, mouse-over the page heading &#8220;Solitude&#8221;. There are a few other minor touches like that scattered around &#8211; and more will be added when they enhance the site. Oh wait, you can&#8217;t see anything unusual? **[Get a better browser](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix "Phoenix home page")**.

While I was at it, I thought I&#8217;d make my site [Bobby](http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/index.jsp) 508 and AAA accessible, which nicely compliments the existing [<acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Mark-up Language">XHTML</acronym>](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/), [<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/) and [<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>](http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Syndication/RSSnewsfeed.xml) compliance. Showing off ends here.

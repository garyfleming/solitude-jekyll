[Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org) has an interesting piece on his site simply entitled [Truth](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/Truth). I especially like the last paragraph.

Too many people, these days, take truth and integrity lightly. To me, a promise is something that you **do not** break. Ever. For any reason.

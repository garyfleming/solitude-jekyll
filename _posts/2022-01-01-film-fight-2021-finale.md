Wow, another year of mostly at home viewing, but with a bit more cinema thrown in, particularly towards the end. It's been a decent enough year for film, with maybe a few too many big-budget action films dominating screens in the back end of the year (looking at you Marvel!).

As per the [caveat every year](hhttps://solitude.vkps.co.uk/2021/01/film-fight-2020-finale/), Film Fight is done in a (non particularly serious) knock-out style: it can pick my favourite film of the year, but nothing else. (Also the very idea of a single favourite film is a bit silly.)

First up is the honorable mentions: films that weren't good enough to win their own month, but still worth seeing.

* Saint Frances
* Pieces Of A Woman
* Soul
* Ham On Rye
* One Night In Miami
* Malcolm & Marie
* I Care A Lot
* Moxie
* Barb & Star Go To Vista Del Mar
* Dead Pigs
* Bacurau
* Concrete Cowboy
* Proxima
* The Mauritanian
* Cherry
* Sound Of Metal
* The Woman In The Window
* Shirley
* Oxygen
* Shiva Baby
* Mogul Mowgli
* Minari
* Body Brokers
* First Cow
* The Best Of Enemies
* Black Bear
* New Order
* Another Round
* The Nest
* Worth
* Kate
* Sweat
* The Guilty
* The Last Duel
* Cop Shop
* The French Dispatch
* The Trouble With Being Born
* Surge
* In The Earth
* Spider-Man: No Way Home
* Don't Look Up
* Azor
* Being The Ricardos
* Encounter


And now the monthly winners:

* January: Babyteeth
* February: Possessor
* March: Judas & The Black Messiah
* April: Promising Young Woman
* May: Nomadland
* June: The Father
* July: Clemency
* August: The Green Knight
* September: Apples
* October: Last Night In Soho
* November: The Harder They Fall
* December: The Power Of The Dog

That's as solid a list of winners as any other year, and genuinely difficult to narrow it down to just one.

The body-horror of **Possessor** has stayed with me through the year; the sign of an excellent, creepy movie. Meanwhile, **The Green Knight** has this beautiful, mythic feel that makes me want to watch it again.

Difficult movies abounded: **Clemency**, **The Father**, and **Babyteeth** are not films I'll be revisiting soon, but only because they were hard enough to watch the first time.

**Nomadland** and **The Harder They Fall** were both beautifully styled, with very different aesthetics: naturalism vs hyper-stylised.

The real challenge, though, is picking between **Promising Young Woman** and **The Power Of The Dog**. Each are excellent in their own ways, playing with our expectations expertly. I don't want to say much about the content of either, because you should watch them without knowing what's coming.

I think I'm going to go with **Promising Young Woman**: darkly funny, tragic, brutal, tense, well-paced, with several great performances. A must see.

I know people have developed some fairly clever systems for organising their priorities and tasks, but I&#8217;m still [using post-it notes to organise](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vkps/120326247/) (yes, it is a total nightmare). I&#8217;m looking for some system which is neither bureaucratic nor rigid.

Constraints:

  * While I can see the point in organising to some extent (there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d remember all that stuff without noting it down), I don&#8217;t want tied into dogma either. Just a simple way of doing things.
  * Paper-based. I am not carrying around a PDA with me.
  * Must be explainable in 60 seconds. If it takes longer than that then it&#8217;s probably far too complicated already.
  * Update consolidation must be easy. That&#8217;s the real problem I have: a bunch of post-it notes that started with 5-10 items, and now have a handful each. There&#8217;s got to be an easy way of pulling together all the random items.

Got suggestions?

One brave soul is dedicating himself to write a new application every day, for 30 days. You can find the fruits of his labour over at [An App A Day](http://www.anappaday.com/). He&#8217;s already 20 days in and, as you would guess, that means he has written 20 apps already. While some are esoteric, one caught my eye as pretty useful.

[Concentrate](http://www.anappaday.com/downloads/2006/09/day-10-jedi-concentrate.html) is a rip-off of a feature found in Expose on Mac OS X which dims all other active windows than the currently focussed window (if that&#8217;s a little off, I&#8217;m sure one of my mac loving friends can correct me). I&#8217;ve only been using it for a day or so and I have to say I&#8217;m surprised by just how effective it is; it really does make you focus more on the active window. I highly recommend a download for anyone who finds that they have app ADD. Couple it with [Winplosion](http://www.winplosion.com/) for double-expose rip-off action.

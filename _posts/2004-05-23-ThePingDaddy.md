Those nice people over at [Ping-O-Matic](http://pingomatic.com/) have finally set up an <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call"><acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>RPC</acronym> interface. If you use any pinging service at all, I implore you to stop and just ping `rpc.pingomatic.com`. Keep it centralised and simple.

First thing I&#8217;ve added to this site in a while.

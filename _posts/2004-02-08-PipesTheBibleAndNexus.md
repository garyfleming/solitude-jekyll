This edition of random links will be much terser than usual, because I lost the first draft and don&#8217;t have time to redo it. Doh.

  * **[Nexus](http://www.project-n.org/software/nexus/index.html)** &#8211; A great idea for screen scraping partial content <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds, but the description makes it sound slightly naive.
  * **[Introduction to <acronym title="Friend of a Friend vocabulary">FOAF</acronym>](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/02/04/foaf.html)** &#8211; A fairly comprehensive introduction to FOAF, for anyone who doesn&#8217;t know what it is.
  * **[Pipes](http://www.softpanorama.org/Scripting/pipes.shtml)** &#8211; A good tutorial on command line piping, for computer users of all levels.
  * **[Hot Links](http://dev.upian.com/hotlinks/)** &#8211; Didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it the first time I saw it, but I have rediscovered it as a fantastic link hub.
  * **[Find In Firebird](http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/archives/000469.html)** &#8211; Always forget the key that does this. A great shortcut.
  * **[213 Thinks Skippy Can No Longer Do](http://www.avalanchetankers.us/archives/000058.html)** &#8211; .. In The US Army. Hilarious.
  * **[Thesaurus Protocol](http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/~gjanee/thesaurus/)** &#8211; A protocol for accessing thesauri over HTTP.
  * **[Crowd Simulation Framework](http://www.knube.org/~csf/)** &#8211; A framework for simulating crowds in Java. Handy for displaying large scale emergent behaviour.
  * **[Optimising Firebird](http://www.farrokhi.net/blog/archives/000235.html)** &#8211; Seen most of these before, but a useful resource nonetheless.
  * **[Things To Not Test](http://harpers.org/TestsForNothing.html)** &#8211; Political correctness gone mad.
  * **[<acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> Is Not OO](http://norman.walsh.name/2003/06/01/xmlnotoo)** &#8211; Sound reasons why XML should not be shoehorned into OO design.
  * **[I Despise You And Your So-Called Taste](http://www.chthonicionic.net/bile/)** &#8211; Funny and scathing remarks about your favourite band, or album.

That&#8217;s all. The coming week will be post-lite, but stay tuned.

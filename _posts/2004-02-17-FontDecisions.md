Deciding on which font to use is always a difficult decision. In recent versions of Solitude, I&#8217;ve tended towards Verdana for almost everything: body text, headers, fields. Now, no more.

Thanks to [What The Font](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/), I can now figure out exactly which great font other people are using for images. This is exactly what the internet is about: stealing (in this case, ideas) through sharing (services). Great.

In all seriousness, it&#8217;s a wonderful service that seems to do its job well. More, please.

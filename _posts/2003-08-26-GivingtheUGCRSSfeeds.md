I was at the UGC website the other day, looking at the listings for my nearest cinema for the billionth time this month. I suddenly had the thought that it would be great if I could get the show times in an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed. Every day I could see what films are on, and what times they&#8217;re showing when checking my email and other RSS feeds.

So I checked the website. Unsurprisingly, they don&#8217;t provide any. The only way to get an RSS feed was to do it myself; my first adventure into screen scraping.

Now, screen scraping is a technique that is notoriously difficult to get right and keep right. It also doesn&#8217;t help that there aren&#8217;t any good tutorials on the subject (expect one soon). The basic idea is to look at a webpage and systematically grab the bits you want.

Long story short: the [UGC Cinemas RSS feed creator](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/UgcRss/) is a way to generate an RSS feed for any UGC cinema in the UK. All comments are welcome, all feedback too.

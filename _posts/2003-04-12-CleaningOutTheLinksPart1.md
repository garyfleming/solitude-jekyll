I decided to clean out my &#8220;reading list&#8221; the other day. It&#8217;s a folder in my Bookmarks of stuff I want to read when I get the time. I deleted most of it before I thought of putting some of it here. So here&#8217;s part 1 of what was left, with a lot of other stuff I was looking at today:

  * Apparently, if you manage to create a folder on windows called _&#8220;aux&#8221;_ then you have to go through [a whole bunch of instructions](http://www.winnetmag.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=3549 "Instructions on how to remove aux folders in Windows") to get rid of them. Via [Glish](http://glish.com/).
  * Tim Bray, co-creator of <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> and good writer, [On Semantics and Markup](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/09/SemanticMarkup) &#8211; an interesting read from someone in his position,
  * It seems that [smiling leads to feeling better](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?id=4047) and not the other way around. Odd. (Link fixed).

Ok, that&#8217;s the lot for the day. More tomorrow.

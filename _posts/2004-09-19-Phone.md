I&#8217;m an Asian film fan (in that I like a lot of films made in Asia, rather than being Asian and liking films, but I digress). I like that films get made there that don&#8217;t cause grey matter to commit beautiful ritual suicide, and that I can imagine such a thing having seen it in such a movie. **Infernal Affairs** showed us that action could be stylish, violent and have a plot, while **Audition** showed us that cheese wire is pretty nasty stuff. Silly ideas can become excellent films.

It is with dismay, then, that I say **Phone** is awful.

Korea is supposed to be where the horror genre is at the moment, having allegedly created the best version of seminal flick, **The Ring**. Sadly, **Phone** shows no signs of intelligence. Instead we&#8217;re greeted with terrible acting, bad dialogue (not aided by a translation that should have been spell-checked), and some of the worst pacing I&#8217;ve seen. This film could have been cut by an hour and retained what plot it had.

Sometimes silly ideas are just silly.

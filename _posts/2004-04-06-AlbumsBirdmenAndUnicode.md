The random links have been piling up for the last two weeks, so time to get on with it:

  * **[Hostile Copy Protection](http://www.nelson.monkey.org/~nelson/weblog/tech/bad/farCryCopyProtection.html)** &#8211; This is surely taking copy protection too far.
  * **[Citizen Kubrick](http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1177734,00.html)** &#8211; Absolutely fascinating look at the archives of Stanley Kubrick. An amazing read.
  * **[Hard Disk Risk](http://www.simson.net/clips/2003.CSO.04.Hard_disk_risk.htm)** &#8211; You really have to do some serious disk formatting to get rid of data.
  * **[Album Covers From Memory, in Paint](http://ilx.wh3rd.net/thread.php?msgid=4457732)** &#8211; Exactly what it claims to be. Some interesting renditions of familiar album covers.
  * **[Unicode Sampler](http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/utf8.html)** &#8211; Samples of different Unicode characters.
  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> Iconv Handler](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-iconv-handler.php)** &#8211; Why was I not informed that converting to UTF-8 would be this easy? I&#8217;ll be doing this soon.
  * **[39 Steps For Story Writing](http://www.usm.edu/english/center/the39steps.html)** &#8211; Sound advice on writing more good.
  * **[Switching from PHP to Zope/Python](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/21/184222/896)** &#8211; Not entirely convincing, but worth a read.
  * **[The Importance Of Fudgeability](http://www.kasei.com/archives/000791.html)** &#8211; Rigid systems die. Extensibility and the human factor must be considered.
  * **[The Nightmare Of Localisation](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Locale-Maketext/lib/Locale/Maketext/TPJ13.pod)** &#8211; There are more problems than you have considered.
  * **[How To Be A Programmer](http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html)** &#8211; Practical advice for all would be professional programmers.
  * **[Jailbird Man](http://www.adultswim.com/games/birdman_jailbirdman/index.html)** &#8211; A flash game based on the fantastic Harvey Birdman. Try and break out some characters you failed to defend.
  * **[<acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>Capture](http://www.danvine.com/iecapture/)** &#8211; See what your site looks like in a range of windows browsers. Useful resource for designers.
  * **[<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> Shell Scripting](http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/03/12/rss_scripting.html)** &#8211; A shell script for parsing RSS feeds. Insane.
  * **[100 Movies That Deserve More Love](http://www.chud.com/news/mar04/mar22underdog1.php3)** &#8211; A list of classic films that do, indeed, deserve more love. Watch at least 5.

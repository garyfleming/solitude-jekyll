In a predictable move, I&#8217;ve made yet another link to places on the web. There is a [Blog Tree](http://www.blogtree.com) button on my navigation bar (as part of my nice little collection).

It shows where this site drew initial influence from (think &#8220;parent&#8221; sites). If, in the future, anyone is influenced by me, I might become a proud &#8220;parent&#8221; myself, with my own children. That&#8217;s a long way away though.

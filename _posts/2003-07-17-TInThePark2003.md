A full write-up of my weekend at [**T In The Park**](http://www.tinthepark.com) would be huge in length and largely tedious. So I&#8217;m going to do this in the shortest style possible:

**The Good**:

  * The weather &#8211; Sunny and bright throughout the weekend,
  * Some of the bands &#8211; including Hell Is For Heroes, Idlewild, Biffy Clyro, The Mars Volta, The Darkness (entertaining, if musically poor), and Funeral For A Friend,
  * The blood red moon on the closing night &#8211; worrying, yet cool,
  * The good people at Lipton Ice Tea &#8211; giving a way a shedload of free ice cold liquid on a boiling hot day marks them as true heroes among men,
  * The copy of &#8220;Chandelier&#8221; I managed to buy after looking for it for a year or two.

**The Bad**:

  * The weather &#8211; Far too warm for most of the day, the queues for water got to be over half an hour long,
  * Some of the bands &#8211; including REM, Turbonegro, The Flaming Lips (sorry, but the lead singer was just boring), The Streets, and The Polyphonic Spree.
  * The finale by Caledon &#8211; embarassing and poorly done,
  * The price of food &#8211; this was always going to be high, but it was ridiculous.

There&#8217;s bound to be more that I&#8217;ve missed, so I might update this entry as I remember.

<cite>Tim Bray</cite> makes some interesting points about [the abstraction of Nations](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/04/Nations). I can generally agree with him on most of it.

But there&#8217;s one thing that I think is important: just because our families and friends are more important to us than our countries, it doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t contribute to our country as a whole. We should help to make it as good a place as we can, since it is within our reach.

From there, our country (government and national organisations) should help other countries. The notion of &#8220;doing good&#8221; could potentially be distributed well across this abstraction.

Of course, that&#8217;s never the way it works. Maybe it&#8217;s late and I&#8217;m tired, maybe I&#8217;m just dreaming, but maybe we could use these arbitary systems to help others in other arbitary systems.

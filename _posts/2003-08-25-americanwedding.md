I&#8217;d almost forgotten that I&#8217;d gone to see this, so I&#8217;ll keep it brief. **American Pie 3: The Wedding** (or one of the other various names I&#8217;ve seen it called &#8211; some too vulgar for a family publication) isn&#8217;t great. That would&#8217;ve been obvious to anyone who has seen either of the first two.

The thing is, it&#8217;s also not absolutely terrible. Even those most hardened against gross out comedies will be pressed not to laugh at least once.

Sure, some of the characters were entirely unnecessary with a handful of lines during the whole film, others had been changed to more suit the mob perception of them. It was, however, still funny in places.

Go see it? Maybe. There&#8217;s no rush to do so, but it is a slow week for cinema&#8230; So why not?

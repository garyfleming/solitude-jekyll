Thanks to the last entry being rushed (I was leaving minutes after I wrote it), the zombie simulator link was pointing to the wrong place. It&#8217;s been fixed now.

It would make sense to add some sanity checks to links in entries: prompt the user if they link to the same place twice in one entry. Not a big idea, but one that would stop things like this happening again.

Anyway, the [zombie simulator](http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/) is a lot of fun. Go play now!

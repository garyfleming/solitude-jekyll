Ding, ding, ding; it&#8217;s time for another round of random links:

  * **[Seven Deadly Sins Of Web Writing](http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2003/nt_2003_07_28_sins.htm)** &#8211; The biggest mistakes you can make when writing for the web, the sort of mistakes that crop up again and again.
  * **[Well behaved D<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>](http://www.sitepoint.com/print/1206)** &#8211; Aaron Boodman writes a good article on unobtrusive, gracefully degrading DHTML. Very much a must read for javascripters.
  * **[Nasubi](http://www3.tky.3web.ne.jp/~edjacob/nasubi.html)** &#8211; The Japanese took it too far with this game show. One day, someone will get an eye out.

I really should start one of those link-based side blogs.

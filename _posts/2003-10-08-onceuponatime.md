As the final part of Robert Rodriguez&#8217;s trilogy of gunfighter films based around the legendary El Mariachi, **[Once Upon A Time In Mexico](http://www.onceuponatimeinmexico.com)** stands strong. While not as exciting as its two precursors, it&#8217;s easily as funny (though none of them are comedies).

The pastiche of Sergio Leone&#8217;s spaghetti westerns is obvious, but not unwelcome or overbearing. The actors play their traditional parts well, even Enrique Inglesias puts in a surprisingly good performance. Johnny Depp, as always, comes off best in his quirky CIA rule.

All in all, a film worth seeing, even if you don&#8217;t really know the backstory.

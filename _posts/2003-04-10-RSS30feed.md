Syndication, syndication, syndication is all I hear on the web these days. I&#8217;ve been providing an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> 0.91 feed for this site from day one (I think), and now I&#8217;ve started supporting [Aaron Swartz&#8217;s RSS 3.0 standard](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/rss30).

The [RSS 3.0 feed for this site](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Syndication/RSS3.txt) was pretty easy to make, all the necessary meta-data gets stored somewhere anyway.

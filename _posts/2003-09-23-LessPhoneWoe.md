Just over a week ago, I experienced some [phone woe](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/09/13/PhoneWoe). While I won&#8217;t bore you with all the details (basically Trium people wanted me to send my phone off to get fixed without telling me how much it would cost, which I didn&#8217;t like the sounds of), I bought a new phone. A spangly Motorola C350.

This post was originally going to be called &#8220;More Phone Woe&#8221; because the synchronisation software provided with the <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> software is pretty terrible. This afternoon, however, it just decided that synchronising my contacts was no longer reason to crash. Hooray! Now, just need to get SMS messages synched and I can start building a software <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> aggregator for my phone (the plans are done).

It&#8217;s only been up for 2 days and someone is already using my [Palindrome <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym>](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/PalindromeAPI.php). Hooray!

[Derek](http://www.mrry.co.uk) is using it in quite a similar way to the already existing form, but who cares? It&#8217;s really just an academic exercise just now anyway. So, go visit the [Palindrome Game](http://www.mrry.co.uk/palindromegame.php).

In related news, I&#8217;m going to introduce a few new methods soon. Just need to get into the mindset to code again.

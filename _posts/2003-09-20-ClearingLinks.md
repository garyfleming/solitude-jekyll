I&#8217;ve got a back log of links that I want rid of, so I&#8217;ll dump them here. They all do exactly what they say on the tin:

  * **[Group Typography](http://www.typophile.com/smallerpicture/)** &#8211; Creating a font based on multiple users ideas of what letters should look like,
  * **[Worst Jobs In Science](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/science/article/0,12543,484153-1,00.htmlGro)**,
  * **[<acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation"><acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language">XSL</acronym>T</acronym> Questions And Answers](http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/sect21.html)**,
  * **[PEAR Primer](http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/stump20021223.php3)**,
  * **[Mind World Map](http://douweosinga.com/projects/mindworld)** &#8211; Users decide what the world map should look like. It&#8217;s starting to take real shape, if only more detail was allowed.

Don&#8217;t know how many of them are worth reading.

This site is, perhaps, the internets finest moment; bursting with comedy, insight and bizarreness. Those are the cornerstones of the web. Well, maybe porn is the cornerstone, but in the absence of that then it&#8217;s those 3 things.

Back to the site: Imagine the world&#8217;s most argumentative couple. And then imagine the male of the pair documenting everything. You get such classic quotes as:

> I eat two-fingered Kit-Kats like I&#8217;d eat any other chocolate bars of that size, i.e., without feeling the need to snap them into two individual fingers first. Margret accused me of doing this, &#8216;deliberately to annoy her&#8217;.

Read the whole page. It&#8217;s full of the most contrived logic. You know, the sort of stuff we all like to use in arguments with people we love.

As their respective code bases have been stable for a few months now (at least), I&#8217;m taking feature requests for both [Acto<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>](/Code/ActoRss/) and [UgcRSS](/Code/UgcRss/). Already requested is the ability to see more than just the current days cinema choices and an update to the cinema list itself.

This is likely to be the only chance to request any features, as I would like to close these projects (except for any necessary screen-scraping fixes).

Just a quick note to say that if you subscribe to my site via RSS/Atom, you&#8217;ll want to change to the new feed: http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/feed/

I&#8217;d been using Feedburner to serve out my RSS feed for a long time, but I think we can all see the writing on the wall for that service, so I&#8217;m migrating away ahead of time. Trying to get logged back in over there to close it down and get a redirect back to the new one, but that&#8217;s proving tricky.

Again, if you use RSS for my site, the new URL to subscribe to is: http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/feed/

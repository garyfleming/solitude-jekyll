My final year project is now complete (expect more on that at some stage), celebrating has been done thrice (just another two more to go), pictures were taken (of the [CompSoc Easter](http://derek.stuwee.org/gallery/CompSocEaster) celebrations at Cafe West), sleep has been caught up on, work has begun on the first project of the holidays, and it feels like a huge burden has been lifted. I&#8217;m not the kind of person to get stressed or panic, but it feels very good to no longer have such a constant and heavy workload.

Enough of this self indulgent tripe. Real posts begin again this week.

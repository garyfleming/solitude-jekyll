From various events that I won&#8217;t try to explain, I started pondering the age old question of how to figure out if someone is a robot or not. I present my findings (with discussion from outside parties).

  * **Use a magnet**: Cheap and easy, but won&#8217;t work unless large machine parts are involved.
  * **Go upstairs**: Again, cheap and easy but only effective on Daleks. And they tend to be easy to spot anyway.
  * **See if they like microchips**: A dead cert to work, but really just a bad joke.
  * **Have a [Voight-Kampff Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voight-Kampff_machine) handy**: Turing tests at the extreme, but pretty handy. Problems: they don&#8217;t exist and if they did you might find out that you are an android.
  * **Hand them a knife**: If they start slamming between their fingers at an alarming speed, then they&#8217;re Lance Henriksen and should be killed immediately.
  * **Cut them in half**: Only works if there are large numbers of machine components. So, cut in quarters. Or, just keep cutting until you see wires. If you&#8217;re wrong, then they&#8217;re not going to complain. Downside: potentially murderous and fairly time consuming.

Those are my methods. If anyone has any better, I&#8217;d like to hear it.

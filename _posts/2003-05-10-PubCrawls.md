The single greatest innovation of recent times: [automated pub crawling](http://www.upmystreet.com/crawl.php3). Just give it some location data (post code, or city name) and it&#8217;ll generate a random pub crawl for you to go on. It changes every time, so the alcoholics (read: students) out there will never get bored. Isn&#8217;t technology wonderful?

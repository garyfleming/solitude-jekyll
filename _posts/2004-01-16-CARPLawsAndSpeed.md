Another random links post:

  * **[Campaign Against Renaming Products](http://carp.iwarp.com/)** &#8211; As all right thinking people know, Snickers should always be referred to as a Marathon. These guys aim to correct the mistakes made by various companies who renamed products.
  * **[ISO hunt](http://isohunt.com/)** &#8211; Find ISOs and Bit Torrent feeds fast.
  * **[Speed card game](http://media.gamerival.com/games/Speed_web_version_upsell_SWF.swf)** &#8211; I&#8217;m sure I played this under a different name, but it&#8217;s still a good and fast paced card game.
  * **[iTunes DRM cracked](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34712.html)** &#8211; The crackers have made the security on iTunes files disappear. Maybe one day the companies will save money by just not bothering.
  * **[Central Limit Theory demo](http://www.stat.sc.edu/~west/javahtml/CLT.html)** &#8211; A very rough demonstration of the central limit theory. Keep rolling dice to see the bell shape emerge quickly.
  * **[What&#8217;s Your Law?](http://www.kottke.org/04/01/whats-your-law)** &#8211; A bunch of laws (not the legal kind).
  * **[Fact Of The Day](http://www.paramountcomedy.co.uk/herb/FOTD_fullpopup.asp)** &#8211; An interesting fact for every day of the year.
  * **[Media Player Classic](http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2004/Jan/13/media_player_classic.html)** &#8211; Tired of the slow, bloated modern Windows Media Player? Then download this and relive those media player 6 days.
  * **[Bugmenot](http://bugmenot.com/)** &#8211; A site that provides passwords for sites that usually require registration, such as the [NY times](http://www.nytimes.com).
  * **[100 Most Mispelled Words](http://yourdictionary.com/library/misspelled.html)** &#8211; The 100 most&#8230; I think you get the picture.
  * **[Cartoon Feeds](http://dwlt.net/tapestry/)** &#8211; A present from God himself, surely. A bunch of <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds for various web comics, including [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com). Subscribed!

And I&#8217;m done.

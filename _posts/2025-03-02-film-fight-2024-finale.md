This is the latest its been in quite some time, but here we are. There are some genuinely great films, but the quality definitely feels like it dipped towards the end of the year.

As per the [caveat every year](https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/2024/01/film-fight-2023-finale/), Film Fight is done in a (non particularly serious) knock-out style: it can pick my favourite film of the year, but nothing else.

The honorable mentions: films that weren't good enough to win their own month, but still worth seeing.

* The Holdovers
* Society Of The Snow
* Poor Things
* The End We Start From
* Self Reliance
* The Iron Claw
* The Zone of Interest
* Shirley
* Monkey Man
* Abigail
* Hit Man
* Kill
* Jackpot!
* Alien: Romulus
* Bad Boys: Ride Or Die
* The Substance
* Wolfs
* Speak No Evil
* It's What's Inside
* Heretic
* Conclave
* Kneecap
* Juror #2

And now the monthly winners:

* January: Priscilla
* February: American Fiction
* March: Dune Part 2
* April: Civil War
* May: Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga
* June: The Bikeriders
* July: Kinds of Kindness
* August: Blink Twice
* September: Rebel Ridge
* October: Strange Darling
* November: Caddo Lake
* December: Anora

This one is quite difficult to pick. There are some epic action movies, with **Dune Part 2** and **Furiosa** working at the high-end of action blockbusters. Villeneuve and Miller continue to be the masters of their craft.

There are some very good indie films that have made it through, like **Strange Darling** and **Caddo Lake** - both films that are presented in very specific orders that become puzzles without distracting.

In very different ways, **Priscilla** and **Anora** centre women who are being pushed in directions that they don't want - with the consequences becoming inevitable.

I think that the winner, though, is **Rebel Ridge**. It's incredibly shot, energetic, with a magnetic lead and a strong cast.

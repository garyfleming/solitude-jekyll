Some surprises came out in this years oscars: the only oscar for [Adaptation](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/adaptation/) was given to [Chris Cooper](http://www.oscars.com/oscarnight/winners/win_32287.html) (Best Supporting Actor). How they managed to lose Best _Adapted_ Screenplay is beyond me. Stupid academy.

I&#8217;m quite glad the Lord Of The Rings didn&#8217;t win many awards this year. The films have been moderately impressive visually, but quite overblown. There&#8217;s a big difference between epics and tedious detail; Peter Jackson just doesn&#8217;t see it.

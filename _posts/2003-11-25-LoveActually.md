The new romantic comedy, **Love Actually**, can be described reasonably accurately in terms of the dimensions of the film it came on.

It&#8217;s a few millimetres across, far too long, and about as deep as a piece of paper.

That does wrap it up nice and neatly but for anyone who wants a slightly extended review, here goes: there are about 6 plot strands that are vaguely interwoven (i.e. the characters know each other vaguely). The characters in each are poorly acted (with the exception of **Alan Rickman** &#8211; but, you know, he&#8217;s Alan Rickman after all), and underdeveloped. You can&#8217;t really care that they&#8217;re all caught up in love because it&#8217;s never built-up or developed on. Everyone is just in love, and you have to both accept and care about it. Nothing is dealt with any further than that. Really.

Don&#8217;t see it. Unless you get dragged by a partner, you have no excuses.

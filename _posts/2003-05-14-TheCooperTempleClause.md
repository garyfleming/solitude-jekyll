After 2 poor support bands and a far-from-capacity crowd, [**The Cooper Temple Clause**](http://www.coopertempleclause.com) were going to have to pull out something special to make it a worthwhile night. While they didn&#8217;t fully succeed in making it a fantastic gig, it was fun.

Despite playing too many new songs to begin with (&#8220;Promises, Promises&#8221; sounding good), they got going when songs from _See This Through And Leave_ started flowing more freely. Best moment was the double-whammy of _Film-maker_/_Been Training Dogs_, easing into the last part of the set.

Even though the crowd clearly wanted more, they band didn&#8217;t play a very long set (around an hour) and no encore. On that front, they have to be looked down on.

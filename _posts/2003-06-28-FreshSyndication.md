For the past week or two, the weblogging community has been working on the conceptual elements that make up a well-formed entry for a website (parts that are necessary, and additional elements). Out of this has come the beginning of a new syndication format and editing <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym>.

The [reasons for creating a new format](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/26/will_the_real_rss_validator_please_stand_up.html) have been discussed elsewhere, with many important people are [supporting its creation](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie "Tim Bray lends his support to the Echo project"). We&#8217;ve got some [very smart people working on it _full time_](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/) (a big well done to IBM for seeing the value in this project and letting Sam focus on it), and we have a constantly updated [wiki for adding to the project](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage). There are literally hundreds of people contributing to it, some a little, some a lot.

What is missing though is a name, a syntax and some real value. The name and syntax are in the middle of being decided on (nothing great so far, and I can only hope that [Shelley](http://weblog.burningbird.net/)&#8216;s suggestion of <acronym title="Personal Publication System">Pubs</acronym> is not used). What we really need is added value.

While I can see the [wisdom in not inventing anything new](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/27/NoInventions), I doubt that a lot of users will. If they have no motivation to use a new format then what makes anyone think that they&#8217;ll change. <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> is a widespread format these days and it&#8217;ll take more than just being very specific in the specification to actually get people to use it.

Personally, I&#8217;ll be setting up a fed as soon as a stable specification is available (I&#8217;ve helped mould the project, I might as well use it), but I wonder if others will.

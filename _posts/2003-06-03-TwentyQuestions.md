Via [Stuart](http://www.kryogenix.org), comes the online version of [Twenty Questions](http://www.20q.net/index.html). Think of an animal, vegetable, mineral (yeah, anyone ever picks that) or object and it asks you questions to hopefully guess it.

It works quite convincingly most of the time, just stay away from &#8220;cafe&#8221; as an object. Although, it learns in time, so even that might not be a problem soon.

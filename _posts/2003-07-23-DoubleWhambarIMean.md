[**Double Whammy**](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0250347) has some promising ingredients; a lead played by [**Denis Leary**](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Leary,Denis), and support from [**Steve Buscemi**](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Buscemi,Steve). There are also some very poor ingredients: [**Liz Hurley**](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Hurley,Elizabeth), &#8220;quirky&#8221; characters, a half-baked plot, and plot strands that don&#8217;t really go anywhere.

Although the preparation is well-done, the film seems to have gone flat somewhere in the middle. Rather than do something well, it tries to cater for everyone; which just doesn&#8217;t work. Those plot strands I mentioned earlier? Too many things going on that are only half done, some quite disconcerting in their lack of conclusion.

For example, a rival cop gets suspicious about a suspect&#8217;s credibility (he says as much). It&#8217;s obvious that he would do some investigation into the matter. Do we see it or hear anything about it again? No. Very annoying.

It didn&#8217;t have to be like this. Rather than slow bake everything haphazardly, one or two elements could have been done to perfection. It&#8217;s a true shame that the better bits didn&#8217;t get a chance to simmer through, because this could&#8217;ve been a great film.

As I said in [last year&#8217;s film fight](/Archives/2005/12/31/FilmFightFinale2005), a knock-out tournament like this can only show my favourite film of the year, not even producing a guaranteed second place, but who cares? Let&#8217;s start with notable films that never took a final place:

  * Shopgirl
  * Jarhead
  * Walk the Line
  * Derailed
  * Capote
  * The Matador
  * V for Vendetta (&#8230; maybe)
  * El Lobo
  * Fearless
  * Beerfest
  * Black Dahlia
  * Clerks 2
  * The Departed
  * Casino Royale

Now the finalists:

  * Cock and Bull Story
  * Good Night, and Good Luck
  * Stay
  * Pierrepoint
  * The Magician
  * Thank You For Smoking
  * District B13
  * A Scanner Darkly
  * Children of Men
  * Little Miss Sunshine
  * The Prestige
  * Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth

Unlike last year, I think I can say that none of those finalists got through by default in a weak month. With just as many notable films as finalists (with more sitting just outside that list), it&#8217;s been a good year for cinema and a hard decision to make. A Scanner Darkly impressed visually and with the deft handling of the source material, The Prestige and Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth were masterfully crafted in their vindictiveness, District B13 was the action film of the year, Cock and Bull Story and Stay were a head-scratching pleasure, and Thank You For Smoking and The Magician were darkly comical.

I think my April tip for film of the year has proven true: **Pierrepoint**. I don&#8217;t think I can say it better than I did in [April](/Archives/2006/10/09/FilmFight2006April "the film fight for April 2006"): &#8220;Starting from humble beginnings, we see the complexities of the man as he rises to fame and descends into a broken shell. A stunning, faultless work.&#8221; A deeply affecting work, that thoroughly deserves more acclaim than it has acquired.

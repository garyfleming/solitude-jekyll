**Charlie Kaufman** has done it again. After the odd genius that was **[Adaptation](/Archives/2003/03/08/Adaptation)** and the reality-blurring screenplay of **[Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind](/Archives/2003/04/04/ConfessionsOfADangerousMind)**, Kaufman is focussing on the idea of removing painful memories using whimsical procedures.

**Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind** is the tale of a couple who share a year of memories together, only to have them erased separately out of spite. As the procedure begins, our hero, Joel, starts to see the big picture instead of the acrimony left at the end of the relationship.

Bringing out some real issues in a beautifully styled, excellently directed film, utilising some quirky humour; this movie is another must see from Charlie. Easily the best screenwriter of modern times.

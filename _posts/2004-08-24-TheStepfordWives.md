A remake though it is, **The Stepford Wives** is a watchable film, if somewhat modest in its reinterpretation. There&#8217;s little of value since the original film, so one has to ask the obvious question: Why bother?

Personally, I&#8217;d like to have seen a Tim Burton take on it. Imagine a slightly camp, fifties style version (full of twee music, crackly pictures and men being men &#8212; rather than the Hollywood gloss version of the same). Then make it pervasively dark. The film could&#8217;ve been greatly improved simply by being more sinister, making the folks of Stepford that touch more unnerving through their pursuit of perfection and the American dream.

Worthwhile? Only if you&#8217;ve not seen the original.

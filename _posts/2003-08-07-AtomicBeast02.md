Up until now, I&#8217;ve been waiting before adding support for [Atom](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage), despite working on the project since the beginning. Well, I&#8217;m waiting no more.

Support has been added in the form of [my Atom feed](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Syndication/Atom.xml). Just need to hope it validates at the [feed validator](http://feeds.archive.org/validator/).

<ins>It does validate!</ins>

The real life of an absolute nobody is not the most obvious subject for entertainment. Taking that life and turning it into a comic, less so. But that&#8217;s what happened to **Harvey Pekar**.

Trying to leave his mark on the world somehow, he decided to turn his everyday life into a comic called **American Splendor**, under the auspice that &#8220;ordinary life is pretty complicated stuff&#8221;.

Now we have the film of the man of the comic of the man.

Pekar is played perfectly by **[Paul Giamatta](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316079/)**. It is, however, a difficult task to make the average man look more interesting than he is.

Ultimately, the film is mediocre, with a few interesting moments. Perhaps it&#8217;s best that way; a true reflection of Harvey&#8217;s life.

Time for another round of random links (if I get time, I&#8217;m going to create some basic link sidebar scripts &#8211; then I won&#8217;t wait a few days until I have several new entries before posting):

  * **[Radiohead Rorscach](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/issues/2003-09-17/music.html/1/index.html)** &#8211; What would happen if you played Radiohead&#8217;s choice moments to a bunch of school kids and asked them to draw? Some very frightening and funny things.
  * **[50 Unsexiest Things](http://www.nerve.com/regulars/quickies/unsexy/)** &#8211; While I can&#8217;t agree with all of them, most are pretty on the money.
  * **[Abbr Vs Acronym again](http://www.benmeadowcroft.com/webdev/articles/abbr-vs-acronym.shtml)** &#8211; One markup debate that I&#8217;m still not settled on. I currently use acronym for everything. This might (read: probably will) change. But life is far too short to obsess over this.
  * **[K<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>2PNG](http://www.babysimon.co.uk/khtml2png/)** &#8211; Create thumbnails of websites. Fantastic! Just wish I was still using Linux as my default OS (until I get a new modem, it&#8217;s not going to happen).
  * **[Firebird edit<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>](http://editcss.mozdev.org/)** &#8211; Modify loaded stylesheets in browser. Great idea, can&#8217;t seem to get it to work in my (admittedly old) Phoenix install.

And I&#8217;m spent&#8230;

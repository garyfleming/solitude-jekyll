I&#8217;ve made a few more changes to the site. Firstly, I finally got round to writing a [new About page](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/About.php). Rather than just being a horrible mixture of previous about pages (themselves mixtures of earlier about pages), it&#8217;s an entirely original one. Hooray for not being lazy for ten minutes!

I also added a [Code](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Index.php) section to the site. This will archive various scripts (including the PHP challenge entries) and programs; for public consumption.

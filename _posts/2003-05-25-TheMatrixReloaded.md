I don&#8217;t really want to say too much about [The Matrix Reloaded](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com) (that&#8217;s got to be the millionth time I&#8217;ve linked to that site in the past week or two &#8211; I really should automate it). I&#8217;ve now seen it and it didn&#8217;t live up to the (admittedly ridiculous) hype I created in my head. I&#8217;ll try to avoid spoilers, but if you absolutely don&#8217;t want to read anything that might ruin the film for you then _do not read ahead_.

Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a good film: full of great action sequences, interesting insights into the workings of The Matrix world, and pseudo-philosophical conversation. But I&#8217;m sure there are a hundred other sites (rightly) extolling the virtues of the film. Go find them. For me the bad points were:

  * **Morpheus** &#8211; or, more precisely, [Laurence Fishburne](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Fishburne,Laurence)&#8216;s portrayal of him. It was considerably weaker than his previous perfomance, and considerably more hammed up. This, to a degree, is understandable (given the circumstances he finds himself in) but jars with my memory of the character.
  * **Possible Changed Premises** &#8211; Is it just me or have the rebels gotten a huge deal better at dealing with agents and other machines? And these ones are supposed to be &#8220;upgrades&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t so long ago that they were saying things along the lines of &#8220;if you see an agent, run, run away&#8221;. Confidence boast or change? Also, Neo is supposed to be able to &#8220;bend the matrix to his will&#8221;. So why didn&#8217;t he? Sure, he flew around a bit and did some Jedi-esque pulling of objects, but so much for being in complete control.
  * **New Characters** &#8211; the new guy who follows Neo around: pointless. Link: unnecessary comic relief. Niobe and Ghost: barely in it (is Ghost even mentioned by name?), but they do make it to the game. 95% of the characters in Zion: boring _and_ pointless.
  * **Impact** &#8211; It just wasn&#8217;t as innovative or ground-breaking as the first one. But that&#8217;s my fault for expecting it to be.

Now, like I said, these things did annoy me, but I did enjoy it. It&#8217;s certainly worth going to see. If you do, sit through the 8 or so minutes of credits for the trailer of The Matrix Revolutions. It looks sweet, but I won&#8217;t be getting my hopes up as much.

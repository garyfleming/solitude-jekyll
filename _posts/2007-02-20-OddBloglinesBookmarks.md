Is anyone else who uses [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com) noticing an odd problem with items being kept new despite not having appeared before?

I&#8217;ve noticed that, on the Digg feed in particular, as I scroll through several items out of the hundreds have already been marked as &#8220;keep new&#8221; despite me having never seen them before. Is this a known bug?

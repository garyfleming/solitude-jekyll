With this August entry, I&#8217;m back up to speed, after the delays for the previous few months.

First up, **The Hoax** is a strange tale about an author that decided to fake Howard Hughes&#8217; auto-biography while the reclusive billionaire was at his peak. Richard Gere has never been better than here, as the self-interested writer who will do whatever it takes to become huge. As his plan unravels, he keeps digging, coming up with more bizarre solutions. An excellent take on a bizarre idea which is, apparently, true.

No-one was expecting much from a sequel to the family comedy **Bruce Almighty**, especially with Jim Carrey replaced by the usually more adult **Steve Carrell**, and **Evan Almighty** does nothing to beat those expectations. If anything this film is more preachy and less funny than its predecessor. I&#8217;m sure kids would lap it up, but there&#8217;s little here for the grown-ups.

Finally, to finish Robert Ludlum&#8217;s trilogy, **The Bourne Ultimatum** casts Matt Damon as the man who can weaponise just about anything in his pursuit for the truth, Jason Bourne. The set-up is relatively simple (a journalist is fed information about Bourne, and Bourne works with him to find out how he became what he is), but brings together a number of great action sequences. This, as with the rest of the series, is a masterclass in how to do action sequences; keeping it near the boundaries of plausible while still spectacular enough to warrant viewing. The plot wraps up more neatly than might be expected too.

I&#8217;m a little torn this month, but I think **The Bourne Ultimatum** edges it over The Hoax because there are so few action films that can get away with not having &#8220;action&#8221; as an excuse for lazy cinema.

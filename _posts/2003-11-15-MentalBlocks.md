Up until relatively recently, I didn&#8217;t think I had a strong mental block (except whilst sitting in exam rooms). As can be inferred, it turns out I do.

For me, it is absolutely bizarre and foreign. Not being able to think about something (for whatever reason) is just so very odd. You start vaguely thinking about the subject and forming questions, but before they get anywhere it&#8217;s all gone. Nothing quite like it.

It irritates and interests me. Thinking about it clearly doesn&#8217;t help (and neither does not thinking about it). What can one do?

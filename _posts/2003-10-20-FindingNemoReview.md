As Disney films go, **[Finding Nemo](http://www.findingnemo.com)** fairs well. It&#8217;s the story of an over-protective father who loses his son. Of course, they&#8217;re both fish. This much you know from the adverts. I&#8217;m sure you can also guess that there are morals and lessons to be learned all over the place.

What you might not have realised is just how funny it is. And that, for once, Ellen Degeneres isn&#8217;t very annoying. She, shock horror, actually manages to be funny.

I don&#8217;t want to say too much more about the film, just that it&#8217;s very funny and very worth seeing.

Yes, I&#8217;m getting lazy, more random links:

  * **[D<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> Lemmings](http://www.xs4all.nl/~crisp/lemmings/)** &#8211; a fully featured version of the cult classic Lemmings. Probably the best DHTML thing since&#8230; yeah. Via [Paranoid Fish](http://www.paranoidfish.org/links/).
  * **[ReUseIT: make Nielsen look good](http://www.builtforthefuture.com/reuseit/)** &#8211; An unofficial redesign for Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s boring site on usability. Should be interesting.
  * **[Protocol7](http://www.protocol7.com/)** &#8211; It just deserved a link for the thorougly decent job it&#8217;s doing of providing interesting links. Recommended.
  * **[Deng](http://claus.packts.net/deng/)** &#8211; A beta version of Deng is out, proving that standards can be implemented in innovative ways with small footprints. Genius.

That&#8217;s your whack for today.

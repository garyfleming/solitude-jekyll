Frequent readers will have noticed a fairly large upturn in the number of posts I&#8217;ve been making recently. For the last year or so, I&#8217;ve averaged around 1-2 posts a month, which is a fairly low amount.

Separately, for a few years now, I&#8217;ve wanted to participate in [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/), where, in the month of November, you&#8217;re expected to write an entire novel. Now, I&#8217;m realistic enough to know that I wouldn&#8217;t make enough time to do that this year. So I wanted to do something else instead, much smaller scale.

I opted to try and write a post each day for the month of November. Obviously, that&#8217;s a lot less than writing a novel, but I felt that it was do-able.

As I&#8217;m writing this, the last post for November, I have no idea whether or not I managed it (this is being written at least a week early, and then scheduled to publish last thing on the 30th). Whether I did or not, I&#8217;ve enjoyed it so far. There have been a number of items sitting waiting to get written for a while, without any pressure to actually do so.

While I am absolutely not aiming to keep this rate up, I do have something of a plan to publish a number of other items over the coming weeks. Hopefully, that&#8217;ll pan out okay and we won&#8217;t get back to that abysmal rate before this month.

Anyway, apologies for some of the lower quality items you&#8217;ve seen (I should not write early in the morning), I&#8217;ll be aiming to make everything from here a lot higher quality.

UPDATE: Turns out I did manage it. Nice.

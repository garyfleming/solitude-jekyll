In addition to [changes made a few days ago](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030328172913), I&#8217;ve updated my style sheets again. This time I&#8217;ve removed elements common to both style sheets and all of my other style sheets. Basically, this amounts to all the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> for the buttons I use, my margin-collapsing rules and other common elements being thrown together in one place to be used ad infinitum. Hooray for re-use!

Separately, I&#8217;ve made the margins for lists smaller, the text for them bigger and their headings (dt in definition lists) bigger. There are a few more little changes that won&#8217;t be noticed at all. This post is really just so I remember when I did what; feel free to ignore.

October was a busy month for me, so there is only one film in the Film Fight&#8230;

First and last up, **Gone Girl** is David Fincher&#8217;s latest, about a man who is accused of abducting and killing his missing wife. The pacing here is masterful, with each act taking the story in a different direction; moving from straight-up thriller to dark satire along the way. As you&#8217;d expect from Fincher, the whole thing looks gorgeous, with a golden sheen over all of those fixed camera shots. While the film is generally well-acted, there are a few of the smaller performances that are a bit broad, but nothing to really put you off. All in all a very good movie (See [my Gone Girl Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/523788534042599424)).

The inevitable winner is, of course, **Gone Girl**.

Another year of film watching done. Back to the cinema for a lot of this, but also a bunch that were first/early release at home. Seems like a lot of low to mid budget films are skipping cinemas entirely these days.

As per the [caveat every year](hhttps://solitude.vkps.co.uk/2022/01/film-fight-2021-finale/), Film Fight is done in a (non particularly serious) knock-out style: it can pick my favourite film of the year, but nothing else. (Also the very idea of a single favourite film is a bit silly.)

First up is the honorable mentions: films that weren't good enough to win their own month, but still worth seeing.

* Licorice Pizza
* Swan Song
* The Eyes Of Tammy Faye
* Petite Maman
* Belfast
* Lamb
* The Tragedy Of Macbeth
* After Yang
* Titane
* The Northman
* All The Old Knives
* Emergency
* Pleasure
* Top Gun: Maverick
* Nope
* Rogue Agent
* Three Thousand Years of Longing
* I Came By
* The Woman King
* The Banshees Of Inisherin
* Emily The Criminal
* Clerks III
* The Menu
* The Wonder
* Bones And All
* The Stranger
* She Said
* Glass Onion
* Corsage


And now the monthly winners:

* January: The Lost Daughter
* February: CODA
* March: Kimi
* April: Mass
* May: Everything Everywhere All At Once
* June: Men
* July: Thor: Love And Thunder (no, I wasn't happy about it either)
* August: Prey
* September: The Forgiven
* October: Barbarian
* November: Pearl
* December: Decision To Leave

We have a decent enough list of winners with only July really letting the side down. 

**CODA** and **Mass** were excellent character and performance driven films, with important but very different messages.

There's more horror on the list than in previous years, with **Barbarian** being the best of three, but **Pearl** being pretty close, especially for that monologue at the end. **Men** was fine, but I don't see myself going back to it much.

**The Forgiven** and **Decision To Leave** have you sitting in a feeling considering what you might do in this situation, which makes for great, lingering cinema.

I'm quite torn. I saw **Decision To Leave** a few days ago so it's still quite fresh, but I also remember the fairly emotional experiences of watching **CODA** and **Mass**.

I think I'm going with **Mass** as my film of 2022. It's a simple setup, mostly four people in one room talking about a tragedy, but you feel every bit of it.

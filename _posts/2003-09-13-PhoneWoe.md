It&#8217;s been one of those fun days, but to save much moaning I&#8217;ll cut to the point: my mobile phone has died a horrible death and it&#8217;ll be a few days before I&#8217;ll be able to fix it or replace it. Fun. I know some people who actually know me read this, so consider this the best notice I can give for a few days.

In my infinite wisdom, I made sure not to keep a list of peoples numbers I had stored separate (on paper etc), so chances are I&#8217;ve lost 90% of the numbers I had. Joy.

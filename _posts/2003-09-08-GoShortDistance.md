A few things I spotted today:

  * **[On Writing Short](http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000318.html)** &#8211; &#8220;Users just won&#8217;t read the instructions&#8221;. They never do. Obvious but useful advice.
  * **[Interactive Go tutorial](http://playgo.to/interactive/index.html)** &#8211; Learn how to play the game, Go. I&#8217;ve always wanted to know how to play this game. Now I at least know the basics. Via [Laughing Meme](http://laughingmeme.org).
  * **[Distance Calculator](http://www.indo.com/distance/)** &#8211; Type in two locations and it&#8217;ll tell you the distance between them. I&#8217;ve been looking for this sort of thing for a fair while.
  * **[Movie Physics](http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/)** &#8211; Haven&#8217;t had a proper look around this site yet, but it does what it says on the tin; talks about movie physics. Could be dull as dishwater, or interesting. No idea.

There should be a big change tomorrow, just you wait.

Today was a bit of a surreal experience. I got an email from myself, from a year ago. I had forgotten about it, but I found a website called [Future Me](http://www.futureme.org/) and promptly sent myself an email.

There&#8217;s no point in lying to you: I think we&#8217;re fucked for these exams. We need to get a 2:1 to get the job with [BigCo]. Did you get it? It&#8217;s looking unlikely from here.

Receiving that was both amusing and a bit disconcerting: I got what I needed so I am working for [BigCo], I&#8217;m living away from home and spending about as much time in my flat as I did at home (i.e. I sleep here sometimes), and I&#8217;m no longer in that band (we never got all that much better). It&#8217;s good to be out of &#8220;study mode&#8221; knowing that I never need to go through that again.

Definitely another few getting sent into the future. Worth a go

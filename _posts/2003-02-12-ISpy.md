I-Spy (starring Eddie Murpy and Owen Wilson) is another black-white buddy comedy. That says almost everything you need to know. So I&#8217;ll just say how much I hate Owen Wilson.

How did this man become an actor? He has exactly one acting style: goofy-dazed. Now that might work the first time he does it. But once you see him in at least 3 separate movies that he does the exact same &#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea what&#8217;s going on&#8221; routine, it gets painfully annoying.

His voice grates. Every word, every syllable is a burden to hear. And when he tries to talk in a &#8220;down with the kids&#8221;-stylee&#8230; urgh!

OK, I&#8217;ll drop it now.

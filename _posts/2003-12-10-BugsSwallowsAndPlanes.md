A reasonably large random link post today:

  * **[Towers Of Hanoi](http://www.kernelthread.com/hanoi/)** &#8211; The classic puzzle in dozens of different computer languages, including an <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> designed to solve the puzzle,
  * **[Ocarina Of Time 2D](http://www.oot2d.com/)** &#8211; Someone is recreating the classic Zelda 64, in 2 dimensions. It looks quite nice, in a retro sort of way,
  * **[Blogshares is <del>gone</del> back](http://www.blogshares.com/)** &#8211; After the recent closing of Blogshares, the site is now back with new management. It&#8217;s a fun game, in the short term,
  * **[Atom Info Proposal](http://www.shellen.com/sandbox/atom-info-proposal.html)** &#8211; A proposal to make Atom readable in browsers (and by means of an extra tag and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>. Why not just cut that down to using an <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language">XSL</acronym> processing instruction? Makes sense to me,
  * **[Ideogram Maker](http://www.bl.uk/cgi-bin/ideogram1.cgi)** &#8211; Decide what various ideograms mean. Via [Kevan](http://kevan.org),
  * **[New <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> bug](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/12/09/nastyBug)** &#8211; A very nasty Internet Explorer bug, making it a lot less safe to enter important details into that browser. Why does anyone still use it? It is garbage,
  * **[How Not To Blog](http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2003/12/08/gothamist_notes_1_what_not_to_do_when_you_blog.php)** &#8211; Starting a blog? Pay attention to most of these rules and you&#8217;ll be fine, possibly even interesting,
  * **[Find MIDIs](http://www.findmidis.com/)** &#8211; An excellent resource for finding MIDI files,
  * **[Free Flight](http://www.ertdfgcvb.ch/p1/fly_2_loader.html)** &#8211; A very absorbing, 3d paper plane flying program. It&#8217;s in shockwave, and is very relaxing,
  * **[Airspeed Velocity Of An Unladen Swallow](http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/)** &#8211; Someone finally figured out the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow. Pythoners worldwide rejoice.

And I&#8217;m done.

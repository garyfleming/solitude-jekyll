It may be a few weeks late, but the Film Fight for May is an extremely light one with only one film.

**Four Lions** is another interesting piece of comedy from Chris Morris. The premise is a comedy that follows a few would-be suicide bombers from their hometowns to training camps and back. Rather than being mean-spirited or relying on controversy, what we get is a great British farce as we see how absolutely incompetent most of the crew are. There are a few stark moments, but it&#8217;s almost entirely silly, poking fun at the idea of the bombers and their ridiculous scheme. (See [my Four Lions Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/13662546747)).

And the winner is&#8230; **Four Lions**. Obviously.

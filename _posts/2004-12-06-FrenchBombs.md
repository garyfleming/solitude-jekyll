A thanks to [Derek](http://mrry.co.uk) for pointing to a <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym> news story about [the French royally screwing up an explosives exercise](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4070973.stm). That is absolutely shocking.

It&#8217;s one thing to train sniffer dogs in an airport, it&#8217;s the real situation they&#8217;ll face, but to plant plastic explosives in a random passengers luggage is just madness. You&#8217;re really just asking for the dog to mess up and let it get away. Surely someone saw this coming.

I&#8217;m sure with this being in France and all that some will put this in the &#8220;News that isn&#8217;t news to anyone&#8221; category, but I&#8217;m genuinely stunned that anyone thought this was a good idea.

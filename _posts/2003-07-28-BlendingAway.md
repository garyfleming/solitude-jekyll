This is (very) old news, but [Eric Meyer&#8217;s Color Blender](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/) is helping me a great deal on the redesign of my site.

I&#8217;ve done about 5 different beta designs: each one taking about 20 minutes from getting a clear idea in my head. The first 4 were scrapped for varying reasons (from &#8220;crap&#8221; to &#8220;too bright&#8221;). The last one though, I think this is a keeper. Not as bold as this design, but a lot more relaxed. Fits in more with my idea of the site&#8217;s title, _Solitude_.

I think relics of the previous designs have crept in (&#8220;Keep the best, throw away the rest, repeat till complete&#8221;), but this one is a lot more distinct. I&#8217;d probably say it&#8217;s quite [Anti-pixel](http://www.antipixel.com/blog/index.shtml) influenced. Make of that what you will.

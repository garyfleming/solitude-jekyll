Yesterday, I finally had my last exam. It&#8217;s been a long few weeks, I&#8217;m tired (as has been pointed out by more than one person) and I need this break. Thankfully, I&#8217;ve got the next 3 months off university.

What will I be doing to fill time? Learning a plethora of new languages (brushing up on javascript, <acronym title="Extensible User Interface Language">XUL</acronym>, Python, Java, C and a few others), working on new features for this site and Finetto (particularly comments and <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> stuff), working (gotta get some cash) and listening to a lot of music.

Full updates return on Monday (or perhaps sunday).

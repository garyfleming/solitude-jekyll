As all the [cool](http://www.mrry.co.uk/articles/1903/ "Christmas post by Derek Murray") [kids](http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/archives/merry_chrimbo.php "Christmas post by Jack Mottram") seem to be doing it(oh the humour in that link text :P), I think it is appropriate for me to wish everyone who has been reading this site a Merry Christmas!

Hope everyone gets what they want, stuffs themselves silly and watches some bad tv tomorrow. Enjoy!

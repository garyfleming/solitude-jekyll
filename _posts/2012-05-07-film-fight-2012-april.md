Just three films in April&#8217;s Film Fight&#8230;

First up, **The Kid With A Bike** is a missed opportunity. It tells the story of a small boy who has been abandoned by his family, for reasons that he doesn&#8217;t really understand. It&#8217;s about him coming to terms with the anger he feels, the difficultly he has in making new relationships, and the mistakes he makes. What should be a sad piece (possibly with a hopeful ending), doesn&#8217;t do the subject any justice. Through failings in pace, dialogue, and direction, it fails to bring any weight to the boy&#8217;s situation. We end up with a smattering of events without the feeling of any deep consequence. A shame. (See [my The Kid With A Bike Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/189027373734301697)).

Sean Penn finds a role that is surprising even for a seasoned character actor like himself in **This Must Be The Place**. Penn plays a fragile and quiet goth rocker, coming to terms with the death of his estranged father while coming to some realisations about the emptiness of his life. Penn&#8217;s performance is, as always, something to behold. For a man who has portrayed so many strongly driven characters, it&#8217;s eye-opening to see him play someone so meek. Sadly, the rest of the film does not live up to the lead: it&#8217;s a slow, meandering slog where not enough happens over far too long a period. It&#8217;s difficult to watch, not due to the subject, but simply because it is largely bereft of worthwhile content. (See [my This Must Be The Place Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/191499444850671616)).

Finally, **The Cabin In The Woods** has taken years to finally make it to the screen, and it has been worth the wait. It&#8217;s in that most troublesome group of films to review; in which any commentary could ruin the first watch, which would be a shame even though it will undoubtedly stand up to many repeated viewings. What can I say? It&#8217;s ostensibly a horror film that is about horror films, but it&#8217;s also so much more. It&#8217;s been put together with craft, style and wit into a package which we haven&#8217;t seen before in many years. I&#8217;ll say no more other than to say it is excellent. Definitely see this film. (See [my The Cabin In The Woods Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/192218517846761472)).

As should be clear, **The Cabin In The Woods** is the clear winner for April.

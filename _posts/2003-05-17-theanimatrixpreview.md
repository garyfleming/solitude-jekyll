In the build-up to [**The Matrix Reloaded**](http://www.whatisthematrix.com), focus has been pulled away from an equally interesting project, [**The Animatrix**](http://www.intothematrix.com); a series of short anime films created by the Wachowski brothers, and the best anime directors in the world. Several are already available on the website. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve seen so far (in order of viewing):

  * **Second Renaissance, Part 1** &#8211; A brief history of how the machine and human war came about. Presented in a realistic anime style, this one is interesting in its details, and brutal in its viewpoint.
  * **Program** &#8211; By far the best of the bunch. Set in the construct, one rebel fights in feudal Japan. So Matrix plus ninjas. Does it get any better? I think not.
  * **Detective Story** &#8211; The weakest of the 5. A detective is hired to trackdown Trinity. It has an interesting film noir style which, despite being interesting, doesn&#8217;t really help the story go anywhere. The ending was very weak.
  * **Final Flight Of Osiris** &#8211; This one ties directly into the story of the film, so I won&#8217;t say anything about plot. It uses <acronym title="Computer Generated Imagery">CGI</acronym> rather than traditional anime, but is all the better for it. Truly one of the best looking pieces of animation I&#8217;ve seen. The only problem was having to pay to see Dreamcatcher to see it.
  * **Second Renaissance, Part 2** &#8211; A look at the war itself from a historical viewpoint, including the fateful moment that we doomed ourselves by destroying the sky. Bit of a low-key ending.

Like I said, they&#8217;re all up for download (except Final Flight Of Osiris) on the [The Animatrix](http://www.intothematrix.com) website. Get them!

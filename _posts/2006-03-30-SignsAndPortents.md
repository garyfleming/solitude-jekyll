While I was gone recently, I spent a few days near Southampton and saw some things I thought I&#8217;d never see. Leaving aside what I was in the area for (which turned out to be a bit out of the ordinary) and the horse we saw standing outside a front door trying (someone was in for a real surprise), Brockenhurst train station has some interesting leaflets to browse through. Some were just us being juvenile, some are genuinely frightening. Have a look for yourself in my first Flickr photo set: [Signs Of Brockenhurst](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vkps/sets/72057594093775379/).

Incidentally, I was surprised by just how easy to use Flickr is. The uploadr software is one of the nicest bits of UI I&#8217;ve seen in a long time.

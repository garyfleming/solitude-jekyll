I&#8217;m feeling kinda [**Matrix**](http://www.whatisthematrix.com)-y today, so I&#8217;ll finally attempt to recreate the essay on the background of the film which was [cruelly deleted](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030515234343). I doubt this will be as good as the original (which took about 45 minutes to write), but I want it out of the way. In fact, it&#8217;s about a million times shorter and is really just a bunch of links now. For shame.

First up is [Reloaded Questions](http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0320/dark.php), an article which focusses on the inspiration of the film, and how the sharp philosophy interestingly contrasts the less cerebral kung-fu moments. Keeping a balance between the ideas and the action, the thinking man and the mainstream, is difficult enough but in a sequel of this magnitude it must be damn near impossible.

Next is [Tantek&#8217;s look at **Burning Chrome**](http://tantek.com/log/2003/05.html#L20030514t0730), William Gibson&#8217;s seminal book of cyberpunk short stories. It introduced the concept of an abstract virtual world known as, you guessed it, the matrix. Lots of terminology found in **The Matrix** originated here and in the remainder of Gibson&#8217;s work.

Interestingly, **The Matrix** starred [Keanu Reeves](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Reeves,Keanu), who also starred in the awful film of [Johnny Mnemonic](), the first story in Gibson&#8217;s **Burning Chrome**. [Gibson defends it](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_05_01_archive.asp#200271614) as not being the version they shot, and with a writer like that, I believe him.

And that&#8217;s it. I did write a lot more originally but fate told me it was not meant to be.

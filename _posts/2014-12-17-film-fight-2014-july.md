Yup, they&#8217;re getting later and later at the moment, but here&#8217;s the Film Fight for July, with 4 films&#8230;

First up, **How To Train Your Dragon 2** is a fun-enough sequel to what was a pretty good kids movie. It&#8217;s not a masterpiece, feeling a little formulaic at times, but it really didn&#8217;t have to be a classic. There are sad moments, fun moments, exciting moments. It does its job of being an entertaining, if light-hearted, film. Enjoyable. (See [my How To Train Your Dragon 2 Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/487890508900212736)).

**Boyhood** is a fascinating experiment: director Richard Linklater assembled his cast every year for a few weeks, ostensibly so we can see the 7-year old boy at the centre of the film turn into a 19-year old man. While the pacing doesn&#8217;t always work, it&#8217;s great to see the actors improve year-on-year. While Ellar Coltrane, as the lead, sees the most obvious evolution, it&#8217;s great to see now-seasoned actors, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, going from serviceable at the start to great towards the end. Very worthwhile. (See [my Boyhood Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/488304043136389121)).

Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a surprisingly good reboot of the franchise, so it was going to be interesting to see where its sequel, **Dawn of the Planet of The Apes**, went next. There&#8217;s a significant time jump and the human population is all but wiped out as the film begins. A small group stumble into Caesar (the ape leader) and his new family, causing tensions to rise. While the supporting cast are sketched in overly broad strokes, the leads are well-drawn characters forced into worsening situations. There are a number of missteps (the music is overwrought, the apes using guns is never earned) but it remains entertaining. A solid action/adventure. (See [my Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/492027135683751936)).

Finally, **The Purge: Anarchy** takes the silly premise of The Purge (that for one night a year no crime is illegal) into a new direction. Where the original was a home-invasion horror, Anarchy is more of a suspense-thriller, in the mould of Judgement Night. Viewed through that almost B-movie lens, it&#8217;s an entertaining film. There aren&#8217;t many surprises, but the action keeps the pace up nicely. Good. (See [my The Purge: Anarchy Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/494889666706165760)).

For July, the winner is **Boyhood**, for being such an interesting cinematic undertaking.

Watching **Chicago** is a lot like falling off a large cliff towards a spike: initially terrifying, your entire life flashing before your eyes, a voice shouting _&#8220;WHY ME?&#8221;_, and, just as Richard Gere begins singing, the spike can&#8217;t hit you fast enough.

Of course, as soon as you want sweet jagged relief, Father Time pulls a fast one and everything goes excruciatingly slowly. Every note hangs in the air for hours, every word spoken in a forced accent cuts, every torturous second eating away at your will to live.

The end never comes too soon.

So, the <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym> are testing the nation again. First time, they wanted to know our <acronym title="Intelligence Quotient">IQ</acronym> (I did well), then our knowledge of current events and now&#8230; relationships. From objective subjects (IQ tests must be objective to count for anything) to something that is so subjective as to be viewed differently by everyone. Great thing to test.

Next up on the BBC&#8217;s schehdule is Favourite Things: you have to pick your favourite film out of a selection of 5 and are then castrated for getting it &#8220;wrong&#8221;. If only Stalin had thought of this.

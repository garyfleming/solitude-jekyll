After a 2 month venture to Nottingham, I&#8217;m back. Although it was originally going to be there for a year, I decided that the job simply wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to do. I&#8217;m unsure about specifically mentioning the company I worked for (very big company, one of the biggest in the world), but for those who know (or can figure out) who I mean I&#8217;d like to say that they are a great company to work for and really look out for their people. It just wasn&#8217;t meant to be.

Anyway, onwards. Solitude will return with more than film reviews (all I could really get away with posting); there are a shedload of links waiting to be put into a link post, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a few things to say about tech.

For the moment, let me tell you a few things I&#8217;ve learned and realised over the last few months.

  * Beeston, the area of Nottingham in which I lived, has far too many pizza places for them all to stay afloat legitimately.
  * Nottingham itself is a beautiful city (even if it does have far too many shoe shops).
  * There are so many good bars and clubs in Nottingham, especially for rock fans. I heartily recommend [The Cookie Club](http://www.cookieclub.co.uk/) on a Saturday, as well as [Rock City](http://www.rock-city.co.uk/).
  * Although I&#8217;m a master chef, I hate cooking. Especially in the morning.
  * &#8220;[Diary](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099453983/qid=1093609534/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-4853879-0585203)&#8220;, by Chuck Palahniuk, is an incredible read.
  * I am a compulsive list writer. Until recently, I had denied and hidden this trait but I have too many lists to continue doing so.
  * Anytime I go to London something goes wrong. Every time.
  * Art, in any form, is exactly what you take from it. Don&#8217;t let anyone, not even the artist, tell you any different.
  * Language is fundamentally tied to culture. To truly understand one, you have to grasp both.
  * [Mclusky](http://www.mclusky.net/) would be the new hotness, if it were not for the fact that they&#8217;re not that new or hot. They&#8217;ll have to put up with being an outstanding band, with an unrivalled live ferocity and a style that is both comical and stone serious.

Expect more on some of those at a later date. For now, I&#8217;m off to catch up with some [old](http://iratescotsman.com "Matt Gemmel's site") [friends](http://chris-miller.org/blog/index.php "Chris Miller's site").

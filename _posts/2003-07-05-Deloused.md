[**The Mars Volta**](http://www.themarsvolta) brought us the experimental **Tremulant EP** as a statement of intentions for their debut album. They spoke big words through layers of noise orchestrated to perfection: and the album lives up the to promise.

While [**&#8220;Deloused In the Comatorium&#8221;**](http://www.theprp.com/reviews/themarsvolta.shtml) borrows much from the bands partial instantiation as the defining moment in rock known as **At The Drive-In**, they&#8217;ve taken their previous band&#8217;s work and gone off in a tangent as fast as possible.

The result is eclectic, but compelling. You&#8217;ll never notice that the majority of the songs break the 6 minute mark (most still going at full pace), it&#8217;s that immersing.

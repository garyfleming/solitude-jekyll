As with [my common caveat last year](/Archives/2006/12/30/FilmFightFinale2006/ "Film Fight: Finale 2007"), a knock-out tournament like the annual Film Fight can only determine the winner and not any of the other places, but that doesn&#8217;t hugely matter (the whole thing being an excuse for me to write about films anyway). Some notable films that did not take a monthly final place:

  * **Them!**
  * **The Last King of Scotland**
  * **Blood Diamond**
  * **Sunshine**
  * **Vacancy**
  * **The Hoax**
  * **Michael Clayton**
  * **Death Proof**
  * **Ratatouille**
  * **American Gangster**

More importantly, the twelve finalists:

  * **The Fountain**
  * **Hot Fuzz**
  * **The Good Shepherd**
  * **The Lives of Others**
  * **Zodiac**
  * **Tell No One**
  * **Edmond**
  * **The Bourne Ultimatum**
  * **Knocked Up**
  * **The Counterfeiters**
  * **Planet Terror**
  * **The Golden Compass**

It&#8217;s pretty telling, to me, that of all the great films this year, my favourite three (**The Counterfeiters**, **The Lives of Others**, and **Tell No One**) are foreign language films that go back to strong narratives, beautiful direction, and character acting, rather than big budget Hollywood efforts.

More than in previous years, it&#8217;s incredibly difficult to decide between those three great movies, but I think the performance of Ulrich MÃ¼he in **The Lives of Others** edges it over the top. A triumph of traditional strong story-telling, the film is a must-see masterpiece.

Without wanting to turn Solitude into a running commentary for the <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym>, a news piece on [PlayStation 2 shortages](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4070755.stm) caught my eye. Hmm, so Sony has &#8220;blundered&#8221; again with it&#8217;s shipping and the net effect is that PS2 is in high demand in the UK? Again. For how many years in a row?

Now, not that I&#8217;m cynical, but could this just be the same thing they do every year to get artificial demand up and get some cheap press (&#8220;PS2 sells out&#8230;&#8221;) before releasing the vast number they have in warehouses after New Year? Or, are they really incompetent at this whole numbers thing? I think we all know the answer.

Don&#8217;t buy the hype, kiddies, get yourself a console with fun games instead (X-Box or GameCube will be fine), unless you like fighting over the last few copies of a console (I&#8217;ve seen it happen &#8211; men and children arguing over that last box or the shipment that might come in next week) that will be flooding back onto the market when it means less to PR.

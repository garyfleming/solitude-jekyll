The [Google Browser](http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html) is a fantastic Java applet that takes in a <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym> and returns a graph of related sites. Related sites comes from the Google index of related sites e.g. here are the [related links for this site](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=related%3Asolitude.vkps.co.uk&btnG=Google+Search).

I&#8217;m not entirely sure how Google creates this related list, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter. Try out the Google Browser to see some bouncy graphs.

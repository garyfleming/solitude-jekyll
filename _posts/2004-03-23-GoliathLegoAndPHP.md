They&#8217;ve been building up for a while now, so time for some more random links:

  * **[TypeKey <acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym>](http://www.typekey.com/faq/)** &#8211; After the backlash, more of TypeKey becomes clear.
  * **[Naming Classes](http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=48)** &#8211; Getting class names can be tricky, here are some best practices.
  * **[Ask Dr Michael](http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000143.html)** &#8211; People asking a 7-year old for advice. Very funny answers.
  * **[Lego WorldBuilder](http://www.lego.com/eng/create/activities/worldbuilder/default.asp?x=x)** &#8211; Really quite fun Shockwave strategy game, based on lego animals.
  * **[Logo Generator](http://www.coolarchive.com/logogen.cfm)** &#8211; An online tool for generating logos in interesting fonts. The first step in the Solitude redesign is being done using this. Via [Kryogenix](http://www.kryogenix.org).
  * **[Goliath](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_neil_g.html)** &#8211; The best of the short stories set in The Matrix (from the official site).

  * **[Screen](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935)** &#8211; An excellent tutorial on the equally excellent GNU multiterminal utility.
  * **[PageRank Calculator](http://www.top25web.com/pagerank.php)** &#8211; Figure out the pageRank of any site. Handy for marketing strategy evaluations.
  * **[100 Most Mispronounced Words](http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/mispron.html)** &#8211; Lists like this are useful just for reference (and a project I intend to begin working on soon).
  * **[Morse Code Music](http://www.kempa.com/blog/archives/000059.html)** &#8211; Morse code messages hidden in music? Some people have way too much time.
  * **[Teach Yourself Programming In 10 Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)** &#8211; Despite what the books may claim, you won&#8217;t do it any faster.
  * **[Dictionary of Data Structures And Algorithms](http://www.nist.gov/dads/)** &#8211; Helpful for above.
  * **[Zend Goodies](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/03/21/zendGoodies)** &#8211; Simon Willison links to a whole bunch of great <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>5 articles.

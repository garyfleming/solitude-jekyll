Despite being a comic genius, Steve Coogan&#8217;s acting ability can leave a lot to be desired. Take **80 Days Around The World**: a commercialised Jackie Chan film for kids with Coogan in the lead role. The results are quite underwelming.

So much so that I&#8217;ll say very little more about the film. A kids film gone wrong.

I just found out about another reason to switch browsers to the Gecko family (I use [Phoenix](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/) personally): keyword searching.

Imagine you want to use a search engine, say Google, (or any site that provides a search facility) to quickly search for information on horses. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you could just type &#8220;google horses&#8221; into your address bar and have it give you all the search results? Well, you can. And here&#8217;s how to do it:

  1. Go to the site of your choice (we&#8217;ll use google), and enter a simple keyword (we&#8217;ll be using horses). You&#8217;ll get something like &#8220;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=**horses**&#8221; back as a URL string.
  2. Remove the search term (horses) from the URL and replace it with &#8220;%s&#8221; (with the quotations) to get something like &#8220;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=**%s**&#8220;. Bookmark this string.
  3. Go into &#8220;Manage Bookmarks&#8221; and look at the properties for the bookmark you just created. In keywords, add &#8220;Google&#8221;.
  4. Go back to your browser and type &#8220;Google horses&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll get your search results.

Very simple, yet extremely clever. I&#8217;ve already created a few bookmarks that you can use (just add keywords): [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com/search.php?q=%s&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&&btnG=Search&sort), [Google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%s), and [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=%s).

Remember, you should be able to do this with just about any site with a search engine, so try it out a lot. Unless you use Internet Explorer. In which case, upgrade and then try it out.

Away from the fairly unhealthy food of last week, there are some meals that I know how to make that won&#8217;t absolutely kill you from either sugar or fat content. They are, however, few and far between. The Beef And Cheese Tortilla is the best of them:

  * Get some Tortillas, preferrably with a light sprinkling of flour.
  * Buy some fresh beef ham. By that I mean, go to a real butchers. I know, fresh ingredients; crazy. You may need to specify that you don&#8217;t want any spices added, depending on how your butcher sells the stuff.
  * Get some peppers.
  * Get a block of strong cheddar. Or, if you don&#8217;t like the finest cheese known to man, pick something else. Your choice.
  * Dice the beef ham and peppers.
  * Grate the cheese.
  * Prepare a **thick** gravy. It should not be watery at all. That would cause a mess later.
  * Fry the beef ham until nearly done (frying pan or wok), then add the gravy to coat it a bit. When it&#8217;s all bubbling and nearly done, add the peppers for the last minute or so.
  * Lay out the tortillas flat and add a few drops of the grated cheese.
  * Fill with the contents of the pan, add more cheese and wrap.
  * Enjoy.

And some people think I can&#8217;t cook anything without a hundred calories. Bah! Next time, how to make a pot noodle.

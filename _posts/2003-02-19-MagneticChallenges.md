It seems that I&#8217;m not the only one challenging people this week. [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org) is playing with [fridge magnets](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/02/18/online_magnetic_poetry.html). My entry?

Seemed astute at the time.

Incidentally, this is the first time I&#8217;ve used an image on this site (in the content). Don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;ll look.

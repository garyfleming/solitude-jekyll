I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to updating the [Archives](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Archives.php) code. Now when you look at a specific month (for example, March 2003), you&#8217;ll get a list of entries and descriptions, rather than a list of days.

This makes it a million times easier to find old items, since you don&#8217;t have to trawl through every single day in the archives to find something. It used to take roughly 30N/2 to find entry N. It now takes N/2. Just a slight improvement, then.

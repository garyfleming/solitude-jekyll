Just a quick pointer to [Daily Dinosaur Comics](http://www.qwantz.com/) &#8211; an online comic about dinosaurs featuring the exact same drawing every day with different words. Some great quotes:

> My friend, thigh fives are a ridiculous way of expressing enthusiasm. I am aware of this!

Funny stuff.

I&#8217;ve never seen unicode mathematics written down quite as simply as [Hixie&#8217;s unicode crash course](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1064324988&count=1).

Read it? Frightened? Good. And yes, that was the simplest version. You can imagine how complex it gets. UTF-16, anyone?

It is, however, worth the effort to incorporate unicode in any product that you build. The benefits include internationalisation, future-proofing, and kudos from anyone else who cries at the sight of that maths.

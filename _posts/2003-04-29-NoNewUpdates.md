I&#8217;ve not really posted much in the last day or two, and won&#8217;t for another day or two. This week is class test week: a whole lot of testing and not a whole lot of time for studying.

Other than working hard, I&#8217;ve started to prepare the next major overhaul of Finetto, the <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> I&#8217;ve been developing (and that runs this site). There&#8217;s a lot of stuff going in that I&#8217;ve wanted to do for ages (Comments, an event-based model for dealing with changes etc) and some new ideas (those can remain private until they&#8217;re implemented).

I&#8217;m surprised at the amount of redundancy I&#8217;m going to be able to remove: there&#8217;s lots of similar code in there just waiting to be made more generic, lots of tweaking waiting to be done.

Anyway, there will be a return to normal service on Thursday, if all goes well.

Upon checking my Hotmail account earlier, I was accosted by a feature alert as I logged in. Apparently they&#8217;ve got rich text editing these days. Despite the fact that I would never use such a feature (I&#8217;m not a fan of comic sans text, or yellow writing on a white background), <acronym title="Microsoft Network">MSN</acronym> deemed it worthy of interrupting my browsing to let me know.

UI design hint 1: _There is a huge discrepancy between what you want to tell the user and what the user wants to know_. Get rid of your fucking ego. If the user does not absolutely need to know something, then don&#8217;t force them to find out anyway. Hint at it, make sure that the information is accessible, but do not shove it in the middle of the interaction; especially in a focused operation like checking email.

After your wade through the initial marketing garbage (again, not helping), you get the instructions. It was the message afterwards that really bothered me though: &#8220;To keep these instructions open in another window, click here.&#8221;

UI design hint 2: _If you think that a feature that will be enabled mid-task has instructions so complex as to warrant being written down elsewhere, you&#8217;ve already blown it_. Instead of wasting your time creating a separate web page that gives diagrams and repeated instructions, fix the real problem: your UI is unintuitive.

A more general rule to finish off: you can&#8217;t fix bad UI with good documentation. Remember that.

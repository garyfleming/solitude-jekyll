Yes, I finally got round to really updating the tech side of this site for the first time in ages. To aid accessibility, comment permalinks now have title attributes attached (not much, but it helps). For those occassions when standard acronyms are to be over-ridden, I&#8217;ve added the ability to switch off auto acronyms. Finally, I added a comment previewing feature (that should keep [Jacques](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/index.shtml) happy, at least). Go on, have a play with them.

I also got round to updating my foaf file. Expect that to change a bit more in the near future when I might get round to adding contacts to it.

Trying to remake the best zombie film of all time is not an enviable task, bringing the inevitable fan backlash and accusations. Thankfully, then, **Dawn Of The Dead** is a more than capable film in its own right.

Although largely stripped of the consumerist overtones of the original, the film still makes sense as a survivalist film, conveying in subtle ways the behaviours that would build up in such a situation.

The whole film is suitably paced: from the swift pursuit of safety in the opening scenes, to the survivors starting to settle into a normal life, to the chaos in the closing scenes. The direction and writing of it all does Romero the justice his contribution to zombie films deserves.

An excellent remake of a classic film.

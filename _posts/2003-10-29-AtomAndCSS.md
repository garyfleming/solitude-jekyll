It had to happen sometime. I knew that as soon as I heard about Atom that someone would inevitably get round to styling the bloody thing, forcing every alpha geek from here to xanadu to do the same (&#8220;but better&#8221;). It finally happened: [Sam Ruby is styling Atom](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1629.html).

Not that it&#8217;s any harder than [styling <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/ 04/27/SyndicationPlusStyle). And not that I&#8217;m going to do it quite yet. I don&#8217;t think there is any demand yet for a stylised Atom feed. I&#8217;ll wait until nearer that time.

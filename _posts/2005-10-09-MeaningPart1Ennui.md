Someone, yesterday, asked me what &#8220;ennui&#8221; means. While it has a dictionary definition (listlessness), it is hard to convey the precise meaning of the word, for me.

  * Lethargic dissatisfaction,
  * Life dragging pointlessly into a grey stupor,
  * A melancholy drudge of indefinite length,
  * Apathy in the extreme.

Not that I&#8217;m currently feeling any of the above, but I think we&#8217;ve all experienced that level of nothingness before. In fact, it&#8217;s a good way to be to truly appreciate the better parts of life.

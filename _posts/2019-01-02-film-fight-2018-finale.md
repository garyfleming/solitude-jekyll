While this finale is a day or two later than normal, Film Fight has mostly run to schedule this year. As per [my perennial caveat](https://solitude.vkps.co.uk/2017/12/film-fight-2017-finale/), Film Fight is done in
a (not particularly serious) knock-out style: it can pick a first place, but everything else is unknown.

First up, the honourable mentions: films that were good but didn't win their month:

* Molly's Game
* Darkest Hour
* Phantom Thread
* Black Panther
* Mute
* Lady Bird
* Ravenous
* Red Sparrow
* Game Night
* You Were Never Really Here
* Annihilation
* First Match
* Ghost Stories
* 6 Balloons
* Roxanne Roxanne
* Isle of Dogs
* Thoroughbreds
* Come Sunday
* Avengers: Infinity War
* Sicario 2: Soldado
* Tag
* Hotel Artemis
* Mission Impossible: Fallout
* Blackkklansman
* American Animals
* Operation Finale
* The Land of Steady Habits
* Bad Times at the El Royale
* Apostle
* Private Life
* The Night Comes For Us
* The Other Side of the Wind
* Outlaw King
* Widows
* Cam
* The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
* Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
* Sorry to Bother You

That's far more honourable mentions than in previous years. Lots of good stuff this year, particularly with Netflix releasing a heap of good indie films at the bookends of the year.

Now, the monthly winners:

* January: **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri**
* February: **The Shape of Water**
* March: **I, Tonya**
* April: **A Quiet Place**
* May: **Kodachrome**
* June: **Cargo**
* July: **Calibre**
* August: **Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind**
* September: **Hold the Dark**
* October: **First Man**
* November: **Wildlife**
* December: **Roma**

First, I want to give an extra nod to **Phantom Thread**. It didn't win its month, and... I'm regretting that now. I loved it at the time, and having seen it again, it's a film of the year contender. That said, the results stand. I've not been pointlessly running a knockout tournament for a decade to change the rules now.

I also want to mention **Sorry To Bother You**. It's UK release was heavily delayed, but it's absolutely worth finding and watching. It's as strong as almost any of the winners, but was just in a strong month.

It's been a very strong year. The late spring/early summer months are a little weaker, but still good; and the rest all hold up.

The weight and dark comedy of **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri**  helped start the year of fantastically, with Frances McDormand rightly taking an Oscar.

Jeremy Saulnier returned with **Hold the Dark**; a creepy tale, with some beautiful shots and fantastic performances (Jeffrey Wright is a great actor). The fact we're now getting films of this quality on streaming services tells you that they should be taken very seriously. More on that in a minute.

There can only be one winner, though. Recency often biases selection, but I think **Roma** is going to hold up as a masterpiece. Alfonso Cuaron's camera work is magnificent: slow, grounded, almost objective. You're forced to live these moments with the characters, not because the camera is frenetically matching them. No, it's slowing down to a normal pace and careful choreography forces you to see everything they do. Beautiful, deeply moving, technically impressive. With **Roma**, Netflix have the first Film Fight winner for a streaming service.

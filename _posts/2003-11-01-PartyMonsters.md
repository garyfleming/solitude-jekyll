Some were billing it as Macaulay Culkin&#8217;s comeback, it&#8217;s not that. Some said it was a work of comic genius, it&#8217;s not that. Some said&#8230; Let us just say that a lot of people have said a lot of things about **Party Monster**. I&#8217;m going to say very little more.

It&#8217;s not very good. By that I mean, and please excuse my use of our robust language here, it is utter shite. It&#8217;s written in such a way as to alienate the audience from the characters, making it rather difficult to care when things go wrong. Sure, there are some funny moments, but they&#8217;re only moments; seconds that die off as quickly as they arrived, leaving you just as cold to the characters.

I could say more, but I think everyone has said enough.

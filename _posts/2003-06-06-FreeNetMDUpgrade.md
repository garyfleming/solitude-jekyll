Got a <acronym title="Net MiniDisc">NetMD</acronym> 707 or 505 player? Really desperate for the additional features found in the MZ-N1? Well, thankfully, it will cost you nothing. I recently found a site detailing how to hack the <acronym title="Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory">EEPROM</acronym> to re-enable the nicer features. So if you want to [hack your MD](http://www.dalartworks.co.uk/bhangra/hack_minidisc.php) then follow that link.

I can confirm that it does work on the 707 (v1.3), and assume it works on other versions as well. It&#8217;s worth it for the adjustable speed alone.

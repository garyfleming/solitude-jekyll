Recently, to solve a puzzle, I wrote a function in <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocesor">PHP</acronym> that determines whether or not a given string is a palindrome. After a little work, it now works perfectly. It&#8217;s not case-sensitive, removes white-space and get&#8217;s rid of non-alphanumeric characters.

It&#8217;s been added to the [Code archive](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Index.php) and can be [viewed directly](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/IsPalindrome.php "Palindrome Code").

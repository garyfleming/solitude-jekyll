Three films in this month&#8217;s round-up:

First up is **Looper**, a brilliantly structured narrative about inevitability, love and sacrifice, seen through the eyes of a killer tasked with the murder of his future self. While that sounds convoluted, it&#8217;s not in practice; the film focusses much more on its themes than on the sci-fi mechanics that allow the story to move forward. While having Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a younger Bruce Willis is a big stretch, the acting through-out is solid. It&#8217;s a big and bold tale, often quite pretty, but fantastically paced. Very worthwhile. (See [my Looper Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/253620585622548481)).

**The Campaign**, meanwhile, manages to undersell what could&#8217;ve been a great comedy. The premise is solid enough (a sleazy, corrupt politician takes on a well-meaning, naive upstart), but it never really amounts to anything. In the final edit, it feels like there are a number of segments they wanted to show and they built a fairly flimsy plot around putting those pieces together. It is funny, but it&#8217;s just not cohesive enough to be great. Passable, though. (See [my The Campaign Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/258652587434336257)).

Finally, **Taken 2** is a bit of a let-down on every level. While no-one would&#8217;ve expected a great, character-led plot, it fails to make much of its action sequences. There&#8217;s a decent car chase in there, a few little moments, but nothing that grabs you as much as the relentless and breathlessly executed sequences from its predecessor. While that was a well-executed action film, this sequel feels very much like a needless and ill-advised cash-in. Avoid. (See [my Taken 2 Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/258652934965972993)).

The winner for this month is **Looper**, for its brilliant take on time-loop movies.

From the moment certain people started shouting about how blogs are killing [Google](http://www.google.com), it was inevitable that the company itself would start an official blog.

The fresh [Google Blog](http://www.google.com/googleblog/) is only 2 posts old, but one worth watching. I just wonder if the backlash will start against this particular blog.

I finally got around to integrating the fantastic [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) into Finetto (the <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> for this site). Thanks to [Dean Allen](http://www.textism.com/) for letting me use it.

Incidentally, this will be the first public post I make since the integration so if anything goes wrong, ignore all that praise.

With enough twists to make anyone doubt every characters motives, **Cypher** is surprisingly well-written for how subdued it is. It&#8217;s the story of Morgan (**Jeremy Northam**), a man who wants to escape the drudgery of his life by going into espionage. Inevitably, he gets into a lot more than he wanted.

Surprisingly, the film also shows that **Lucy Liu**, the lead female character, can actually act. Shocking, when put side by side with her work in **Charlie&#8217;s Angels**.

It is not the best film in the world, the twists do start to push it after a while, but it&#8217;s certainly a great deal better than some of the garbage that is being showing recently.

If you&#8217;re wondering why I&#8217;ve been so quiet here (and on [my twitter](http://twitter.com/garyfleming)) it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been quite busy elsewhere. I won&#8217;t bore you with the details, but I will say that the silence will continue for a short while as I will be moving house at the end of the week. As always with these things, it will take a few weeks to get a phone line and internet access sorted.

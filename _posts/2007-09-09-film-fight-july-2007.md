July&#8217;s cinema selection was a fairly mixed bag.

After 12 years of waiting, **Die Hard 4.0** finally makes an appearance. You mostly get what you expect with this one: a bunch of action sequences held together by a somewhat ridiculous plot, some over the top villians with questionable motives, and John Mclane killing everyone. You get that all here, but it&#8217;s all a bit too ridiculous, too over the top. If you can switch your brain to off, then you can enjoy it. Otherwise, this may be a bit wide of the mark.

Having only seen Glengarry Glen Ross recently, it was a pleasure to see another film by the same playwright, David Mamet. **Edmond** is about a man who loses his place in the world and goes about trying to find it amongst the seediest parts of New York. Surprisingly dark in tone, this film doesn&#8217;t hold back in its vision of the terrible things people can justify to themselves. Superbly shot, with exceptional dialogue, the one caveat being that it&#8217;s origins as a play are fairly apparent, Edmond is an excellent film. Highly recommended.

**The Simpsons Movie** is what most people expected, a long episode of the series. Thankfully, though, it would be an episode from one of the later single-digit seasons. While not as good as the earlier episodes, it doesn&#8217;t degenerate as far as the later series which were almost entirely variations on &#8220;The Simpsons go to [insert place and vaguely racist jokes here]&#8221; or &#8220;Homer works as [something stupidly unlikely and unfunny here]&#8221;. Although the best joke was spoiled by the trailer, there are still enough set-ups here to make it worth seeing.

Finally, **Transformers** is Hollywood at its very worst: crass, loud, brainless, and without style. If it had been two hours of robots fighting, I could have gotten behind that. If it had been built-up with any tact, that&#8217;d been fine. Instead we&#8217;re treated to an episode of Dawson&#8217;s Creek, numerous advertisements, some terrible comic relief, and more plot holes than I&#8217;ve seen in any other film in recent times. Even the few action sequences on offer are merely perfunctory. I mean, no-one should&#8217;ve been expecting a masterpiece here, but if the action scenes aren&#8217;t up to much (they&#8217;re either mostly off-screen or a blurry mess), then what is the point? The film is almost entirely without merit.

The obvious winner this month is **Edmond**.

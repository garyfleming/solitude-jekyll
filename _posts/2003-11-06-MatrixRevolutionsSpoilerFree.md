After failing to secure myself a seat for yesterdays opening screenings, I was forced to see the final part of the [Matrix](http://www.whatisthematrix.com) series today: **The Matrix Revolutions**.

With the lacklustre second installment still fresh in my mind, it was with slight trepidation that I went to see this part. I was surprised to find it was significantly better than part 2. Without wanting to spoil any of it, all the action that was missing from **Reloaded** had clearly been shunted into the series&#8217; finale.

Good parts:

  * Lawrence Fishburne has thankfully decided to start acting properly again, after the ham that was produced last time,
  * Great action sequences,
  * Some (minor) surprises,
  * The sections in Zion.

Bad parts:

  * A particular part near the end (saying any more would amount to a spoiler),
  * The new characters being largely pointless, and many old characters being superflous,
  * The ending &#8211; it was lacking, but probably how it had to be,
  * The bits that weren&#8217;t explained or that just happened.

All in all, a good film. Not up to the first, but good nonetheless.

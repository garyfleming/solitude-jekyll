Funny how there&#8217;s always 2 sides to a relationship: [his](http://www.harpold.com/500/paddock/00000206.html) and [hers](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/05/things_hannah_had_no_intention_of_telling_andrew.html).

Apparently, every relationship has list like these. I can&#8217;t begin to imagine what mines would be like. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll figure it out soon enough.

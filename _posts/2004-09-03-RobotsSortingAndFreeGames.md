Yes, it&#8217;s been a long time since the last random links post but it&#8217;s time for a big one. I&#8217;ve been building up the links for 2 months now, so there are more to come. All the usual stuff is covered: flash games, <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>, <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> and other tech. Enjoy.

  * **[Race Conditions In Security UI](http://www.squarefree.com/archives/000487.html)** &#8211; A security exploit aimed specifically at advanced users. Cunning.
  * **[Sorting Algorithms](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/misc/sortalg/)** &#8211; Visual comparisions of Java sorting algorithms. If you like this, you&#8217;re too geeky for your own good (but it&#8217;s a valuable resource nonetheless).

  * **[HTML Overlays](http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/20040830/HTMLoverlays.html)** &#8211; A way of minimising markup using javascript to import common elements. It all still validates too.

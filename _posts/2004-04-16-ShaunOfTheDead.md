In a departure from other recent zombie films, **Shaun Of The Dead** actually makes use of the Z-word. Not that that is important, just an observation.

The film itself is fantastic. A top-notch script, some excellently timed jokes, and hilarious acting. The Reservoir Dogs homage is worth seeing all on its own.

There&#8217;s not too much bad to be said about it, apart from the ever so slightly cheesey best friend fart moment.

Probably the best film this year, thus far.

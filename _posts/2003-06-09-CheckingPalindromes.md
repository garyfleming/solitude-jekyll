Since my [palindrome checking code](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/IsPalindrome.php) is getting a fair few hits, I thought I would update it. The optional second parameter is now gone, because it was a lot of hassle for little reward.

Additionally, I thought I&#8217;d create a little interface for it. Behold, [the Online Palindrome Checker](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/Palindrome/IsPalindromeForm.php). It&#8217;s just a simple form, but it works well enough.

Bonus: if you use the Gecko family of browsers, you can use the [automatic search feature (outlined earlier)](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030324140525) to set up a keyword to it. Personally, I use the rather obvious choice of &#8220;Palindrome&#8221;. You might want to try something else.

As mentioned earlier, I went to see **House Of 1000 Corpses**. Don&#8217;t do the same.

Although it has some good (but brief) moments, and one of the funniest lines in cinematic history, it fails to be scary or funny. The horror and gruesomeness are muted by the lack of tension, comedy overtones (who can take rednecks seriously?) and the poor characterisation; you really won&#8217;t care when people are being butchered. That said, the comedy isn&#8217;t overt enough to be truly funny. Sure, you&#8217;ll giggle when the rednecks get angry, but nothing overt.

It&#8217;s not worth seeing. Really.

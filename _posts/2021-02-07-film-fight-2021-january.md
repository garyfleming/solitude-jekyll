A fairly good start to the year despite, or maybe because of, the lack of cinemas.  I'm keeping the change I made during lockdown: rather than fairly strictly new releases from the last month or so, it's anything since all of this started since timeliness is less relevant. I'll start disallowing the older films in that at some point.

I watched 11 new films in January.

There's some really good options for January, but I think I'm going to go with **Babyteeth**.

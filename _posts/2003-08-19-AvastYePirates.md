As much as I expected it to be a big budget wash out, **Pirates Of The Caribbean** is actually reasonably entertaining. **Johnny Depp** leads with his usual balance of excellent timing and quirky delivery, **Keira Knightley** plays her part adequately, and **Orlando Bloom**&#8230; He showed up.

Yes, the plot is predictable, some of the lines are horribly overwritten, but there are enough mildly amusing bits to make it a worthwhile watch. Certainly a **lot** better than that [hideous dog shit](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/08/19/Chicago "Chicago, tedious film of the year") I watched later the same day.

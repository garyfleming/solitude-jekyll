I know what you&#8217;re thinking. You&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Gary, we love Solitude,Â  read your [twitter](http://twitter.com/garyfleming), go to all your [del.icio.us links](http://del.icio.us/solitude), and listen to everything you do on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/VKPS/) but is there any way we can follow you just a little bit more/easier?&#8221;.

Well, gentle readers, inspired by [Joe Gregorio&#8217;s Me Page](http://bitworking.org/news/297/Anti-Social-Software), I&#8217;ve set up my own [readr account](http://www.readr.com/profile/vkps).

By subscribing to/reading, [my readr page](http://www.readr.com/profile/vkps) you can now stalk me in one single space, with my Facebook, Myspace, Bebo, Jyte, Good Reads and more all appearing. Heck, it even aggregates all my online games of Halo 3. It even has the bonus that if I start producing content somewhere new, I can easily add it to my readr account and you automatically start seeing it. Enjoy!

(P.S. Of course I don&#8217;t believe anyone actually needs/wants this, but I am interested in this kind of aggregation for my own purposes. I think when the social graph becomes truly open, this kind of content-mulching will be very interesting.)

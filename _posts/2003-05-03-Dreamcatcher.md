The film [Dreamcatcher](http://dreamcatchermovie.warnerbros.com/) is bad. Words can&#8217;t possibly sum up the badness. In fact, I&#8217;ve done my absolute best to wipe most of it from my mind.

It starts out reasonably: 4 friends reunite and reminisce about how they got super-powers from a mentally handicapped boy they saved from bullies. Yes, that&#8217;s the reasonable part. After that, all manner of bizarre (read: shit) plot contrivances make it laughably bad.

I would recommend people see it, if only for the short film they&#8217;re showing before it: &#8220;Final Flight Of Osiris&#8221;, part of the [Animatrix](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/) films (no direct link). Now that&#8217;s how you make a film.

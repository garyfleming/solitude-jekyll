How can days start off so well and then go down the toilet so fast? Everything was going great. I had a decent (last) day at uni, and everything was roses. Then I came home and thought I&#8217;d do some work on improving the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s around here.

Locally (I run an Apache server on my own computer), I got everything looking nice: <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym>s everywhere, and everything looking simplified and clean. Things worked well. Now, despite the test sampling I tried a few days ago that worked fine, when I uploaded, my host crapped out. It refused to load any page that used the mod_rewrite rules I specified.

After a while of trying the new permalinks (of the form /News/2003/05/19/#PageTitle), I gave up. But then my host completely crapped out. The server went done and <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> calls were blocked for a long time (or so it seemed). So, not only did the new URLs and permalinks not work, I couldn&#8217;t change them back.

In the meantime, I though I&#8217;d try out the new version of [Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/). Needless to say, it didn&#8217;t go well. Although everything was initially fine, after a few minutes pages would take forever to load and then the browser would drain all resources. The net result was that pages didn&#8217;t show and my music wouldn&#8217;t play. Fun.

But, as things usually do, things semi-worked out: I got the old files uploaded (so those lovely new permalinks don&#8217;t exist anywhere but on my computer), and managed to revert to my old version of Firebird. So nothing lost, but nothing gained.

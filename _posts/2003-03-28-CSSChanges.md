I&#8217;ve made some very minor changes to both of the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> files this site currently uses.

All paragraphs have a larger leading space, a greater line height and slightly larger font. Combined, these changes make things a bit easier to read (hopefully). It&#8217;s still in need of some tweaking but that can wait until some other day.

If you can&#8217;t see a difference, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> together to reload the stylesheet.

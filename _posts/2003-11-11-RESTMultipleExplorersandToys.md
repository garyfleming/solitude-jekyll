The rather belated end of week random links post. We&#8217;ll just call this a fortnightly special (with nothing special added) and leave it at that:

  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> and <acronym title="REpresentational State Transfer">REST</acronym>](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/10/30/amazon_rest.html)** &#8211; A good read for those planning on setting up the Atom <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym>,
  * **[Ze&#8217;s page](http://www.zefrank.com/)** &#8211; An interesting mix of random stuff. The games and toys are good; particularly &#8220;Simple Game&#8221;,
  * **[Multiple IE instances](http://www.insert-title.com/web_design/?page=articles/dev/multi_IE)** &#8211; How to run multiple versions of IE. Very handy for web design,
  * **[On Search: Internationalisation](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/11/SearchI18n)** &#8211; Another part of the essential On Search series. This time dealing with the problems inherent in making search work in different languages,
  * **[Bit Rot](http://stevenf.com/mt/archives/000453.php)** &#8211; Data always outlives hardware. So just what lengths will people go to to get information from old systems? Probably about this far,
  * **[Misusing Irony](http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,985375,00.html)** &#8211; A personal pet hate: the misuse of the word &#8220;Ironic&#8221; (Via [Derek](http://www.mrry.co.uk)),
  * **[Advanced <acronym title="Rock Papers Scissors">RPS</acronym>](http://www.worldrps.com/advanced.html)** &#8211; Want to get better at Rock, Papers, Scissors? The professional guide is available,
  * **[IE 5.5 Band Pass](http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/ie55winbandpass.html)** and **[IE 5.0 Band Pass](http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/ie50winbandpass.html)** &#8211; After last months mid pass filter, [Tantek](http://tantek.com) brings two more filters to make applying styles to particular browsers easier. He never sleeps.

And that&#8217;s it for a few days.

I found a link to [nntprss](http://www.methodize.org/nntprss) the other day and have to say how great an idea it is. It allows you to read <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds in any newsgroup reading software that you might have.

Now, not a lot of people use newsgroups anymore (compared to when it was _the_ killer app of the net), but I do. So being able to read news from all the sites I visit in a simple straight-forward manner in a familiar interface (in my case, **Outlook express**) is very useful. I recommend this to anyone who uses newsgroups and reads any site with an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed.

I just need to set it up as a windows service, rather than having to use the command prompt everytime I start-up, and it&#8217;ll be perfect.

Update: I&#8217;ve created a very fast and nasty way or working around the problem of executing nntprss at start-up. Just use the following code as a batch file:[batch-file code](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/nntp/nntprss.txt).

<ins>UPDATE: The word &#8220;start&#8221; has been added to the code to make the command prompt created by the batch file disappear on completion. Thanks to WildShaft!</ins>

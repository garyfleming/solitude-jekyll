A week ago, I was searching for something on [Google](http://www.google.com) and came across a link to this very site in my search results. It was linked to a page in my archives about <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>. So, I did the natural thing of clicking on it.

Because of the way the archives worked, the page no longer had any entries regarding <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>. Every time a new entry was added, each entry was pushed back by 1 entry on the archive. After 5 entries were added, it had been pushed off that archive page altogether.

This worried me. A <acronym title="Uniform Resource Indicator">URI</acronym> should point to the same information all the time. So I began work on a new archive system today. It&#8217;s now done and available for all to see ([the Archives are here](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Archives.php) for those who don&#8217;t know).

This time pages are archived by date, rather than some arbitary position that doesn&#8217;t matter. So, it&#8217;s now far more static and indexable.

**Igby Goes Down** starts bleak, gets more depressing as time goes on and yet still manages to end cheerily without seeming forced. The story of a teenage boy born who rebels against the values he is born into: that of the upper classes. While certain parts of the plot are extraneous, it builds a fantastic view of the protagonists world and his (lack of) ambition.

Featuring a fantastic cast (including [Kieran Culkin](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Culkin,Kieran), [Bill Pullman](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Pullman,Bill), [Susan Sarandon](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sarandon,Susan), and [Ryan Phillippe](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Phillippe,Ryan), among others), great direction and a genuinely interesting script: I would highly recommend this film.

A few quick links for the weekend (nowhere near as many as normal, but sleep beckons):

  * **[Operashow Generator](http://people.opera.com/howcome/2004/operashow/)** &#8211; Use [Opera](http://www.opera.com) as a cheap but pretty powerpoint substitute. A very nice feature.
  * **[Decompression Bombs](http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/001711.html)** &#8211; Overload most computers by creating special zip files. They start off at 7k, and unzip to 100Gb. Frightening, cool and utterly amazing at the same time.
  * **[iCapture](http://www.danvine.com/icapture/)** &#8211; A service that displays pictures of websites as seen by Safari, for all the appleless developers. Handy.
  * **[Unicode Spaces](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars/spaces.html)** &#8211; Unicode has an insane number of space characters. Wasteful.
  * **[Free Rockstar Classics](http://www.rockstargames.com/classics/)** &#8211; Rockstar are offering their old games (optimised for modern PCs) for free. The current two are the classic Grand Theft Auto, and Wild Metal Country. A superb idea, and absolutely the right thing to do.

And that&#8217;s all for the weekend.

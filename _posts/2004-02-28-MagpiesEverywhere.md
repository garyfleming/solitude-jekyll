Although I&#8217;m loathe to include any personal entries on this site, I feel compelled to write about something odd I saw today. I was (and to an extent still am) having a terrible day, and on the way home I spotted something odd: 24 magpies.

One for sorrow, two for joy&#8230; and all the rest. Now, as I recall, the things you get for seeing more of them get better and better as you go. Six is for gold, seven for a secret never told. Twenty-four must be one hell of a great thing; and I know what I want.

24. 24. More soon.

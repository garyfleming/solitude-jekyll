In an extremely tenuous link to [the last post](/Archives/2005/12/03/DeFactoAudioTest "De Facto Audio Test"), I recently managed to get a hold of an album, &#8220;Megaton Shotblast&#8221;, by Texan outfit **De Facto**. Why am I mentioning this? Because they are the band who were more influential in forming prog-rock supremos **[The Mars Volta](http://www.themarsvolta.com/)** than their prior band, **At The Drive-In**.

Formed as a side project while At The Drive-In were still going strong (that split causing the well-documented Mars Volta/**[Sparta](http://www.spartamusic.com/)** divide), De Facto make an interesting sound: mixing up dub influences, with jazz, salsa, electronica and the tiniest smattering of prog. The album is the obvious pre-cursor to the long instrumental sections found on both Mars Volta albums (as well as their live shows, where 20 minutes is not too long for a solo), as the vocals are near non-existent.

If you&#8217;re a Mars Volta fan, it&#8217;s well worth it, but not necessarily if you&#8217;re just an At The Drive-In fan; this is self-indulgence at it&#8217;s most powerful and worst, if you don&#8217;t like lengthy solos.

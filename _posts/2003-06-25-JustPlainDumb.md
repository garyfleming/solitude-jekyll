No point in wasting time here, **Dumb And Dumberer** is just plain dumb (I know, that&#8217;s probably been said by a million monkeys at typewriters). The original had a stupid charm about it, a juvenile but functional wit. The <del>sequel</del> prequel is just dumb.

Idiotic, moronic, brainless: totally lacking the humour of the original.

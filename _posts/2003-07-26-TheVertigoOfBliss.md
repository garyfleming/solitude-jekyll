The second album by [**Biffy Clyro**](http://www.biffyclyro.com) took only one day to record, yet sounds as highly produced as any other modern rock album. Titled &#8220;**The Vertigo Of Bliss**&#8220;, it is not as immediately catchy as their previous efforts but the pay-off comes in the long term.

After a few listenings, it becomes clear that it&#8217;s a more mature album with enough hooked chorus to make each song of anthemic proportions. All I can do is recommend it, and their previous album &#8220;**Blackened Sky**&#8220;. Fantastic stuff.

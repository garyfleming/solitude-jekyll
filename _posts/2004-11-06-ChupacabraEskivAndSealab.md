Random links. Far too many for a single post, so expect more tomorrow. Today is the usual mix of games, stories, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and other such stuff:

  * **[Radio Shark](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/)** &#8211; An AM/FM radio device that connects to PC and macs to provide time-shifting and recording functionality.
  * **[English Pronunciation](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/plamere/20040714#letter_to_sound_rules_the)** &#8211; The many problems apparent in trying to do proper text to speech in English underlined here.
  * **[Mobile Atom](http://franklinmint.fm/2004/09/27/mobile_atom.html)** &#8211; Makes J2ME devices become Atom enabled.
  * **[Princess](http://www.trioplus.tv/plus/princess/content.html)** &#8211; Short cartoon from the Matt Stone and Trey Parker (of South Park fame). Not work safe.
  * **[12 Steps To Better Code](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)** &#8211; All sound steps if you work in a corporate environment.
  * **[Variable Resolution Layout](http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/09/21/)** &#8211; Interesting way of giving different screen resolutions different layouts. Not just resized, but more appropriate layouts.
  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> 5 object references](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/)** &#8211; Differences in the way objects are referenced between 4 and 5. Vital reading for anyone doing serious development.
  * **[Reverse](http://www.scenta.co.uk/reverse/)** &#8211; Irritating flash game where you have to move a cursor from one end of a course to the other. There is, of course, a catch.
  * **[Opera Supports <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>HttpRequest](http://www.scss.com.au/family/andrew/webdesign/xmlhttprequest/)** &#8211; Expect to see a lot more sites using this feature over the coming year, now that the major browsers all have support in some way.
  * **[Tarantino and Takashi](http://www.twitchfilm.com/archives/2004/09/quentin_taranti.html)** &#8211; Apparently, Quentin Tarantion has given Miike Takashi permission to do a Kill Bill side story. Not as a film though.
  * **[CSS Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/indexlist.html)** &#8211; An index of all CSS 2.1 properties. Handy.
  * **[Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide To The Galaxy Game](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml)** &#8211; The HHGTTG text adventure game now on the <acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym> website.
  * **[Face To <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>](http://www.theletter.co.uk/log.php?id=17/archives/2004/07/the-weekend)** &#8211; We should all put a face to our sites. Not entirely convinced, but might do it later.
  * **[Sealab Interview](http://suicidegirls.com/words/Sealab+2021+-+Adam+Reed/)** &#8211; Interesting interview with the creator of Sealab 2021.
  * **[Eskiv](http://www.fetchfido.co.uk/games/eskiv/eskiv.htm)** &#8211; A flash game somewhat like snake and Jezball.
  * **[Metadata For The Masses](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000361.php)** &#8211; Absolutely agree with this. Tagging is the way forward for categorisation.
  * **[If Architects Had To Work Like Web Designers](http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2004/10/if_architects_h.html)** &#8211; Amusing.
  * **[Zombie 3](http://www.hardcorepawn.com/zombie3/)** &#8211; The 3rd iteration of the zombie simulation. Now a java game where you have to kill the zombies, but keep humans alive.
  * **[Comple Guide To Isometric Pixel Art](http://rhysd.syntesis.org/tutorial/chapter1point1.html)** &#8211; Learn how to draw pixel art in Paint.
  * **[<acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> Hacks](http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks.php)** &#8211; Exactly what it claims to be.
  * **[New Ed Wood Film](http://newyorker.com/talk/content/?041025ta_talk_paumgarten)** &#8211; The once thought lost hardcore copy of Necromania has resurfaced and is being released.
  * **[Pixies Interview](http://www.mtv.com/bands/p/pixies/news_feature_090704/)** &#8211; An interview with The Pixies.
  * **[Chupacabra](http://skepdic.com/chupa.html)** &#8211; Everyone&#8217;s favourite Mexican goat eating demon.
  * **[Google IM](http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5412359.html)** &#8211; Speculation that Google will hit the IM market next.
  * **[Onchange Dropdown menu](http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/10/19/)** &#8211; Javascript widget to make more accessible and intuitive dropdown menus.
  * **[Crazy Train](http://www.livejournal.com/users/koaloha/29646.html)** &#8211; And finally, an amusing tale of zealots being ridiculed on the subway.

More tomorrow.

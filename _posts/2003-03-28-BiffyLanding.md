A few nights ago, I went to see the excellent [Biffy Clyro](http://www.biffyclyro.com/) play live. Here&#8217;s what happened.

First, support band were the very poor [Span](http://www.span.mu/site.php). Sounding very much like a poor man&#8217;s [Danko Jones](http://www.dankojones.com/) they failed to impress from the outset. This was further compounded by the lead singers ill-advised and badly put speech about George Bush and the war. Unfortunately for him, he was playing in front of a largely pro-war crowd.

Next support band was the amazing [JetPlane Landing](http://www.jetplanelanding.com/), Whom I&#8217;ve seen before. They were, as usual, excellent; mixing new songs and old comfortably. From their 8 or so song set 4 new songs were played: the name of the first wasn&#8217;t mentioned (I think it was &#8220;Effect A Change&#8221;), &#8220;Strength Of Our Convictions&#8221;, &#8220;Conventional Thought&#8221; (the best of the bunch) and &#8220;The Violence&#8221;. How many bands are confident enough in their new material to devote half of a half-hour set to it? Importantly, though, it worked.

After what seemed like a moment of absolute genius, they left the stage and made way for **Biffy** themselves. I was surprised by just how good they were (to be honest, it was **JetPlane Landing** as support that convinced me to get a ticket). They rocked. But, at the end of the last song of the main set, Simon, lead singer, decided to jump off the amp stack; he landed badly and had to be carried off stage, and no encore. Turns out his leg is broken.

All in all a good night. I bought another copy of &#8220;Zero For Conduct&#8221; by **JetPlane Landing**, this time on vinyl and, with the exception of **Span**, enjoyed the whole thing.

Note that &#8220;TAR file smart CR/LF conversion&#8221; in WinZip is only smart if you happen to know it exists and aren&#8217;t doing cross platform development which is being screwed up by said conversion. Hours wasted.

Tool developers: if your tool isn&#8217;t supposed to mung the date in some way, leave it alone.

Following on from yesterdays [iTune Vs Winamp 5](/Archives/2003/10/22/iTunesVsWinamp5) post comes a few more iTunes horror stories.

Firstly, Dylan Greene is claiming that [iTunes is the worst windows app ever](http://www.dylangreene.com/blog.asp?blogID=276). Oucho.

Secondly, [The Great Metadebacle](http://www.idly.org/2003/10/17/the_great_metadata_debacle_of_2003.php) shows in detail what I meant about moving files around. That&#8217;s just not on.

I won&#8217;t post the rest (do a feedster search if you must know). Either it was a really lazy port, or it just plain sucked in the first place. I don&#8217;t know which.

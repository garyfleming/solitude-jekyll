It&#8217;s time for Solitude&#8217;s first obligatory birthday post! Yes, it has been a year since I ditched the increasingly huge workload of VKPS and started this much easier to manage blog.

What has been accomplished in this year at Solitude? [285 posts](/Archives/ "285 archived posts, currently") (one every 1.2 days), some [new toys](/Code/), a deeper undestanding of this web standards mess (<acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>, Atom&#8230; I love you all), and a whole mess of mindless link propagation.

So, what can you expect from the next year? Although I&#8217;m tempted to shift focus to something new just for the hell of it, I know that I&#8217;m going to be knee-deep in code for the next few months. Expect a lot more on web standards, information from an as yet undisclosed project being worked on as part of my course work this year, more fiction (there was really very little there, yet I got a very warm response from what there was), more toys (there are at least 2 in my mind just now), and of course more links.

<ins>I think you can also expect shorter, but far more frequent posts, amonst the longer posts I&#8217;ve tended towards.</ins>

Hopefully, you&#8217;ll stick around for another year.

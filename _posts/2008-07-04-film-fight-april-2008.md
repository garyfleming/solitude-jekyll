I know, I know, it&#8217;s late again. It&#8217;s been a fair while since I&#8217;ve seen these but let&#8217;s crack on anyway.

**Funny Games** is shot for shot remake of a German film of the same name (by the same director), about the commercialisation and desensitisation of violence in the media. Told through the eyes of a family who are held against their will, it takes us on a fairly dark journey, using some impressively lengthy shots to force us to keep watching. The direction and camera work is pretty flawless throughout, as is the dialogue; perfunctory and sharp. The film is an unerringly focussed on it&#8217;s core questions of &#8220;Have you seen enough yet?&#8221; and &#8220;Is this still entertaining?&#8221; It succeeds masterfully. Highly recommended.

Rod Hilton has done another excellent job of parodying **[21](http://www.the-editing-room.com/21.html)**, but I&#8217;ll say a little more. What we have here is a good idea, done in the worst possible way. We have a film that is dumbed down as far as it will go: MTV style jump-cuts, paper thin characters, plot holes, awful dialogue, the works. It&#8217;s been designed as a music video and, for a film about card counting, that&#8217;s not good. Even if you want an easy film, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s better fare on offer elsewhere. Avoid!

**In Bruges** is a bit of an odd mix: ostensibly a comedy, but with a thoroughly dark vein running through it. After a kill gone wrong, two hit men are ordered to hide out in Bruges where they begin to face up to what they&#8217;ve done. Had the film continued with that, it could&#8217;ve been very good. Sadly, it loses itself exploring the quirky characters they meet and the childish jokes that Colin Farrell&#8217;s character passes off as banter. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s entirely merit less: there are some laughs in here. In a quiet period, it might be worth a look.

As is my obligatory remark for this kind of film, I love zombie films. Spanish horror, **Rec**, is exactly that. Initially the single point of view handycam style gives it a Blair Witch feel (not a good thing), it quickly settles in. About a siege in an apartment block and the panic that surrounds the resident&#8217;s attempts to escape, we see old conceits work remarkably well. The story is nothing more than ordinary (well doled out), but the visual impact is impressive. Horrific in places, reasonably tense, but let down by a weak end sequence. A shame that the last scene lets it slip. Still worth a view.

Finally, **Persepolis** is an animated film from Iran (redubbed by an impressive American voice cast) following the fall of civil rights in Iran, and the eventual persecution of non-conformists. Told through the eyes of a young girl growing up and eventually viewing her heritage from afar, Persepolis is simultaneously wryly bleak and dimly amusing. The story is a worthwhile one, but often the pacing feels too slow and the feel too quiet. You sympathise with the main character&#8217;s plight, but can&#8217;t warm to her as a person. Not a terrible failing, but one that makes the film drag more than it could.

The winner for April is **Funny Games**, a dark vision and a pointed question combined into an excellent piece of cinema.

So, you&#8217;ve listened to all your music enough to be able to reproduce every word, identify every instrument (make and model) used and wonder if there&#8217;s anything left for you? Well, of course. Try some new music from the [<acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym> live sessions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/musicscotland/air/sessions.shtml). it&#8217;s basically tonnes of new bands playing songs, live. I especially recommend **JetPlane Landing**, **Biffy Clyro** and **Bis**.

Now, while they&#8217;re all real media files only available for streaming, I&#8217;m sure certain elements among you can figure out how to download them using a program like StreamBox. Actually, forget I said anything about that program. Dodgy stuff. Yep, forget.

A particularly large selection of links this week:

  * **[Gmail Skinning](http://persistent.info/archives/2004/10/05/gmail-skinning)** &#8211; Through a mixture of Firefox extensions and the browser&#8217;s support for user <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, Gmail is now skinnable. I can see this becoming a **very big** thing.
  * **[Zip Decode](http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/)** &#8211; A demo of zoomable maps, using postcodes to target areas. Takes an age to load but does the job.
  * **[Min-height: fixed](http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/09/16/minheight_fi/)** &#8211; Someone has finally sorted out the problems with minimum height across browsers. Another handy CSS tip.
  * **[Currency And Legal Tender](http://www.siliconglen.com/Scotland/1_7.html)** &#8211; Some interesting points about how legal tender works in Scotland, and how non-legal tender is still valid currency.
  * **[Darque Dungeon](http://www.epsilonminus.com/darquedungeon/)** &#8211; Amusing reworked comic strip. Very funny stuff. Search around on the site for another similar piece.
  * **[Creating A Mozilla Extension](http://www.mozilla.org/docs/tutorials/tinderstatus/)** &#8211; Something that I want to learn but have never had the time. Another example for [writing extensions for mozilla](http://extensions.roachfiend.com/howto.php) is right there. Not sure if these are new enough to take into account the changes made to Firefox extensions recently but are bound to be decent starting points either way.
  * **[More On The Underground Cinema](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1302250,00.html)** &#8211; In one of the recent links posts there was an article on a secret underground cinema in Paris. This article talks to someone who claims to know the group responsible.
  * **[How To Fold A T-Shirt](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/fold.php)** &#8211; Wow. That is an impressive piece of folding.
  * **[Warioware 2](http://hello.typepad.com/hello_nintendo/2004/09/mawaru_made_in_.html)** &#8211; After the brilliance of the original, I can&#8217;t wait for this tilting based sequel (although I wonder how multiplayer games will fit into this new way of working).
  * **[Google Aptitude Test](http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001031.html)** &#8211; Google do recruiting in an unconventional way. Some great questions in there, particularly 19.
  * **[Struggling With The Web](http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/09/16/perplexing)** &#8211; The web is easy to use, it just doesn&#8217;t hand hold you through every detail.
  * **[Gmail Drive](http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm)** &#8211; Set up your Gmail account as a drive in Windows. Absolutely fantastic stuff.
  * **[Zoom](http://razghul.ice.org/misc/zoom/zoom.htm)** &#8211; Shockwave zoomed image that goes on for&#8230; well, a long time.
  * **[Transformers History](http://www.angelfire.com/tx3/scorpionsnest/tfhistory2003.html)** &#8211; The complete Transformers backstory, from billions of years before the original series to the end of the beast wars. A great deal of information. Read only if you have hours to spare.
  * **[Not Just Usability](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/NotJustUsability.html)** &#8211; Joel argues that usability is not the most important thing in an application. A good idea will win out over bad design.
  * **[<acronym title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</acronym> News Online Wikiproxy](http://www.whitelabel.org/wp/wikiproxy.php)** &#8211; News Online wired up to wikipedia. Simple but great idea. The BBC should incorporate this into their basic system.
  * **[Understanding Base64 Data](http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3386271)** &#8211; A quick overview of how base64 works and how to implement it in Java.
  * **[Tiny Plaid Ninjas](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/plaid.php)** &#8211; And finally, tiny plaid ninjas. Aha.

Still a lot more to clear out, but they will have to wait for now since I can&#8217;t be bothered compiling the rest of this list today.

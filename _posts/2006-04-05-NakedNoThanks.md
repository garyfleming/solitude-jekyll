So, a bunch of people think that by [&#8220;going naked&#8221; today](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/) that they can make the web better by promoting web standards, proper semantics and yadda-yadda. Now, I&#8217;m all for web standards and <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and all that, having been on the [X Philes list](http://www.goer.org/Markup/TheXPhiles/) since it started and generally encouraging standards, but this is a bloody silly idea.

Here are two scenarios for you, decide which is more likely:

  1. A user stumbles on a site that is stripped of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and follows a link to the main Naked Day site, where they read all about the purpose (which isn&#8217;t actually explained in any detail) and say, &#8220;By George, I should be making my site better, like this great looking site!&#8221;.
  2. A user stumbles on a site that is stripped of CSS and says, &#8220;By George, this site is either hideous or broken, best be going to another one that actually works&#8221;.

Sorry guys, but who is it you&#8217;re actually trying to reach? Either people already know about standards or not, and then either care or not. Making your site look crappy, even if perfectly usable won&#8217;t convince anyone. Just because it&#8217;s usable without stylesheets doesn&#8217;t mean people want to use it. You see that&#8217;s the side of usability that everyone seems to have forgotten for this idiocy: that you have to make the user want to use the site. If anything, this will have people running for the table-ridden sites that don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re broken.

Here at Solitude, we appreciate the spirit of the day, really, but the implementation is broken; we&#8217;ll keep the clothing on, thanks.

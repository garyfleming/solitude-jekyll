The first random links post of the year, plentiful in size and usefulness:

  * **[Plink](http://beta.plink.org/)** &#8211; Just what <acronym title="Friend of a Friend vocabulary">FOAF</acronym> needed, a pretty looking parser and search service. Nice.
  * **[Speech Reversal](http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/)** &#8211; An article on reversing speech in songs, and human perception thereof.
  * **[Smarty For Beginners](http://codewalkers.com/tutorials/56/1.html)** &#8211; A fairly straight forward tutorial on the Smarty templating language.
  * **[Live Comment Previews](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/archives/000317.php)** &#8211; Very cool use of javascript to provide a live preview of comments as they are entered. Could get quite complex, dependent on text processing, but great nonetheless.
  * **[Shrook Intervals](http://daringfireball.net/2004/01/intervals)** &#8211; A misbehaving <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> reader? Maybe it should be more [polite](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/12/26/PolitenessAndAgents "An article on agent politeness").
  * **[Banished Words](http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2004.php)** &#8211; A list of words banished for 2004. None will be missed.
  * **[Gawsh](http://www.staggernation.com/gawsh/)** &#8211; Google results displayed by host. Could be useful to someone.
  * **[GoogleSynth](http://art.gen.nz/index.php?page=gs)** &#8211; A program that pulls 2 random images from Google and blends them together. Mostly crap, but some interesting results.
  * **[<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> vault](http://www.9rules.com/cssvault/)** &#8211; A stronghold of CSS tips. Bookmark it.
  * **[Escher For Real](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gershon/EscherForReal/)** &#8211; People creating the impossible designs of Escher for real. Absolutely bizarre.
  * **[Google Spellchecker](http://markpasc.org/weblog/2004/01/01_google_spelling_revisited)** &#8211; Using Google to check if a word is spelled correctly. Simple, but very smart.
  * **[Accept Headers Broken](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2003Mar/0060.html)** &#8211; Almost no browsers do Accept headers correctly. Not surprising.
  * **[Quick Guide to C#](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/quickcsharp.asp?target=Quick|C#)** &#8211; Learn C# quickly, if yo already know Java.

And we&#8217;re done.

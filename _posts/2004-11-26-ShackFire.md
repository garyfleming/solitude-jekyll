Tragedy hit last night for many students when [The Shack burned down](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4044259.stm). Famed among students for cheesey pop, the lack of access will mean having to go to, shock horror, The Garage.

[Stuwee](http://stuwee.org), unofficial spokesman for The Shack, was said to be &#8220;totally gutted&#8221;. Expect him to set up a support group soon.

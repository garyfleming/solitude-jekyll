Via [Jacques Distler](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/) comes news of a plug-in for internet explorer that allows it to understand <acronym title="Maths Markup Language">MathML</acronym>: [MathPlayer](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/).

A great and useful tool it will be given that there will be no new versions of <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> made available for free download (according to Microsoft). But it shouldn&#8217;t be up to a third party company to fix the deficiencies in the browser: Microsoft, if it is to show any commitment to the web, should have added this a long time ago.

Sadly, it won&#8217;t happen. If IE is going to change, it will be the hackers that change it. Or people could try changing browsers. [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/) is brand new, much faster than anything else on the market, will be constantly updated, and does everything you could possibly want from a browser. It has a large development community working on extensions to make it do even more.

Take back the web, as the new FF motto goes, get a browser that works well.

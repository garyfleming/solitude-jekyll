Yes, yes, it&#8217;s late, I know. For June, we have 5 films in the Film Fight.

First up, **The Purge** has an interesting enough premise: for one night, the rule of law is suspended in order to allow people to exercise their pent-up emotions. Murder, as you might guess, is rampant, and this goes predictably badly for the protagonists of the piece. The problem with the film is that it can&#8217;t seem to settle on what it wants to be: it sets up a social commentary but doesn&#8217;t give it the time to breath, instead degenerating into a home invasion horror with just a hint of Funny Games thrown in. If it had focussed on either side, it might have been better, but as-is it&#8217;s a predictable and mindless horror. It&#8217;s not awful, but you won&#8217;t see it again any time soon. (See [my The Purge Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/341654142634295296)).

**The Iceman** sees Michael Shannon deliver another mesmerising performance as an ice-cold hitman. His paranoia and shady dealings see his life beginning to unravel in ways he can no longer control. It&#8217;s not exactly an original story (though it&#8217;s based on a true one), but the lead performance makes it worth the admission by itself. Even though some of the supporting cast are notably weak (you&#8217;ll want to switch off any time his family appear) and the last section feels rushed, it&#8217;s still a great film. (See [my The Iceman Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/344588014556676096)).

Whedon&#8217;s first film after The Avengers couldn&#8217;t be much more different: **Much Ado About Nothing** is a timeless take on the Shakespeare play. It is fantastically well-done. The cast, stuffed with Whedon alumni, nail every part, bringing out the wit and comedy of the source material in every scene. It&#8217;s beautifully shot, shown in black and white, with nothing extraneous to slow down the pacing. There&#8217;s not a moment where you feel that it doesn&#8217;t work, and that&#8217;s without compromising the play for a modern audience. An excellent film that feels small and perfect. (See [my Much Ado About Nothing Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/347831755018997760)).

I am a big zombie move fan but having heard about the post-production issues with **World War Z**, I didn&#8217;t hold out much hope. I was surprised to find, then, a film that was not without charm. While every character in the film was utterly two dimensional, there merely to service the plot, the whole thing worked quite well as a big, dumb action film. The pacing was frantic for all but the last act, which was a nice little diversion. It&#8217;s certainly not a masterpiece, but it was quite fun. (See [my World War Z Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/350956013538656256)).

Finally, **This Is The End** is the epitome of Judd Apatow style comedies. If you hated or loved Superbad, Knocked Up or Pineapple Express, you&#8217;ll feel exactly the same about this. By now, you&#8217;ll undoubtedly have heard that it features James Franco, Seth Rogen et al. playing versions of themselves at a party on the fateful night of the apocalypse. Hopefully you won&#8217;t have heard about too many of the cameos or the silly ending, as there are some great moments that shouldn&#8217;t be spoiled. Again, this film will really depend on how you feel about the cast. I enjoyed it, but if you&#8217;ve seen them before you know what you&#8217;ll think. (See [my This Is The End Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/351792782114947074)).

The winner for June is **Much Ado About Nothing**, a flawlessly executed take on a classic. Contender for film of the year.

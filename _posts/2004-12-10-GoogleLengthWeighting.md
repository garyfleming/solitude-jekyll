So, Google have got a new toy. [Google Suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1) uses some funky javascript to get the top results for your request as you type it, character by character. Although it was a little sluggish at first (slow connection that was being used to download a lot at the same time), it works pretty well.

Just for fun, figure out your own Google Length Weighting. Type in your name, character by character, until a search result appears in the suggestions which will list you at the top (spaces count towards the count). The number of characters is your Google Length Weighting. At the moment, I&#8217;m about a 7. What are you?

**Update**: Of course, within twenty minutes of posting, I find out that someone else has had the same idea. Ned Batchelder has the same [Google Suggest game](http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/200412.html#e20041210T101332) (sans numbers).

<ins><strong>Update 2:</strong> As it is with all things hackery, good suggestions get made. That is why we now have the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=182186">Google Suggest Firefox Extension</a>. It&#8217;s proof of concept at the moment, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be taken further.</ins>

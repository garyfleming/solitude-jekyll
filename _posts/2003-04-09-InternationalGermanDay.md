Put on your lederhosen and get ready for some sauerkraut: it&#8217;s International German Day! Have a look at some sites related to the wonderful country over there:

  * **German Toilets**: German engineering is better than everywhere else, they say. We say, [do something about the loo](http://www.spies.com/~scott/misc/toilet.htm),
  * **Funny Phrases**: heading to Germany and need to confuse and amuse the locals? Why not spit out a [funny German phrase](http://www.seattlesatellite.com/tom/german.html) or two? Say number 4 and you&#8217;ll have to fight the m&auml;dchen off,
  * **German jokes**: Ok, so [German jokes](http://www.ahajokes.com/german_jokes.html) aren&#8217;t that funny but, um, well, yeah,
  * And, of course, **Hitler**: Now, without trying to offend anyone, apparently [Hitler was pretty cool](http://hitler.notian.net/), (if you ignore that Holocaust thing).

Now go forth and tell everyone you meet to enjoy International German Day. If they don&#8217;t, we have ways of making them.

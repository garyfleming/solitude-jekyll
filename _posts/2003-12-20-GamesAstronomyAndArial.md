Since I&#8217;ve been unable to update this week, the random links have amassed into a **huge** pile. To make sure you&#8217;re not completely overwhelmed by them (there are around 30), I&#8217;ll prune them a bit and split it into two posts. The other half should be out either tomorrow morning or Monday night. Onwards:

  * **[Snowfight 3D](http://www.miniclip.com/snowfight.htm)** &#8211; Following on from the classic Starcraft clone, Snowfight, comes the 3D version. Requires Shockwave, but damn good,
  * **[Fan And Ball](http://www.ertdfgcvb.ch/p1/fan_and_ball.html)** &#8211; The rather tricky game of moving a ball along a track using a fan. Also requires Shockwave,
  * **[Simpson&#8217;s Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox)** &#8211; An odd bit of maths that occurs due to weighting differences,
  * **[Atlas Of The Universe](http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/)** &#8211; A map showing the major formations within the universe, centred around our solar system,
  * **[<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> lightcone](http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/)** &#8211; Following on from the previous, get an RSS feed of the major astronomical bodies entering your lightcone. Only 13 months until HR8832 enters my lightcone and I can be blamed for stuff over there,
  * **[Non-Semantic Semantics](http://www.esws2004.org/)** &#8211; In a genuinely ironic move, the European Semantic Web Symposium&#8217;s website is pretty far from semantic. It uses tables for layout and, painfully, uses images instead of text for **every** single word. Via [Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com),
  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> highest scripting language](http://www.google.com/search?q=scripting+language)** &#8211; Although, as [Simon Willison](http://simon.incutio.com) notes, Python is highest on a  [search for programming language](http://www.google.com/search?q=programming+language), on a [google search for scriping language](http://www.google.com/search?q=scripting+language) it takes second place to PHP,
  * **[Bluestumbler](http://bluestumbler.org/)** &#8211; Information on the horrible insecurity found on most bluetooth enabled devices; including mobiles,
  * **[Computerman](http://www.channel101.com/show.php?title=computerman)** &#8211; I wish I had broadband so I could see Jack Black&#8217;s new show.

Next lot will be coming soon.

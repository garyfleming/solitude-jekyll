From <cite>Philipp Lenssen</cite>, the same guy who made [the MemoMarker I mentioned a few days ago](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030523121801), is a brand new new toy: [The EgoBot](http://blog.outer-court.com/egobrowser/egobot.php).

Ask it a question and it will query [Google](http://www.google.com) and make up an appropriate answer. For example, I asked it &#8220;What is your quest?&#8221;, and got back &#8220;My quest is and has always been: to create music, dreams and words that dance through sound&#8221;. Very impressive stuff for a chatBot-style script. Like most scripts of this nature, it&#8217;s fun for a while.

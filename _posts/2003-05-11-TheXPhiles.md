Further to my post about [Content Sent Correctly](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030509234103), I&#8217;ve been added to Evan&#8217;s list of sites that pass all 3 tests called &#8220;[The X-Philes](http://www.goer.org/Markup/TheXPhiles/)&#8220;. So far, only 11 sites are on that list.

What I didn&#8217;t mention before-hand, is that there is actually a 4th test: Why do you use <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>? So thought it might be worth answering that one, even if it isn&#8217;t necessary.

  1. **To learn** &#8211; the best way to learn a new technology, for better or worse, is to use it in a practical application. For XHTML, that means building a website,
  2. **Because XHTML is <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>** &#8211; I like XML. It&#8217;s well-formed, logical, and if something isn&#8217;t how you wanted it to be, it&#8217;s probably your fault (rather than a browser bug, as is usually the case in <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>). It&#8217;s also scrappable. If I want to extract any part of my markup without going to stupid lengths, I can do so with any XML parser,
  3. **It&#8217;s semantically richer** &#8211; no more name tag, only one language attribute, and lots more redundancy is gone.

I&#8217;m sure there are other reasons that I&#8217;ve forgotten for now, but I think those are sufficient reasons.

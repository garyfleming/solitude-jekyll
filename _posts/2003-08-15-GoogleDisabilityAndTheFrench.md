Yep, it&#8217;s time for some more random links:

  * **[Inaccessible Website Demo](http://www.drc.gov.uk/newsroom/website1.asp)** &#8211; I&#8217;ve been going on about accessibility for long enough now. This site demonstrates exactly why you should care about creating accessible sites too. Give it a try.
  * **[Google: unix of the future](http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/mt/archives/000655.html)** &#8211; With the recent addition of calculator features to the pervasive Google, you can&#8217;t help but wonder if they&#8217;re heading in a command line direction.
  * **[Answer To Everything](http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything)** &#8211; Speaking of Google Calculator, it really does know everything.
  * **[French Military Victories](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/victories.html)** &#8211; I think not.

And that&#8217;s enough for one day.

If you haven&#8217;t realised by now, **Will Ferrell** is a God. Outstanding timing and the kind of naive dumb act that makes the sides tremble as if the largest feather in the world had just been purchased and was heading for your feet. From this modest start, throw in some seventies cheese, unexpected violence, a tight script and quirky supporting cast, and you have the beginnings of a legendary film.

**Anchorman** is that film.

I&#8217;ll say no more because I wouldn&#8217;t want to ruin a single character or line from it. Hilarious from the start to the end of the credits (don&#8217;t leave until the very end).

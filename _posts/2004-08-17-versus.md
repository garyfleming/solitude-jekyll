People who know me know that I have a strong appreciation for zombie movies, the cheaper the better (although Dawn Of The Dead (the original) still holds the crown). I&#8217;m also fairly fond of overtly stylised Japanese gangster movies, or anything with a samurai. Copious amounts of comic blood is also a plus. So, when a film comes along and opens with a zombie being sliced in half by a samurai in an overly stylised way, and quickly brings in the Yakuza, I pay attention.

**Versus** is that film.

The main elements of story can easily be glossed over (magical forest, legendary battles, history repeating, etc) and the film enjoyed purely for its cinematic veneer and ultra-violence aesthetic.

A truly outstanding film. Buy it, rent it, just see it.

When new music comes out, we tend to see it on [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) on release day. That&#8217;s not universally true, but for the labels that have signed up for the service already it tends to be the case (purely observationally). I do wonder what the best approach is:

  * Releasing on Spotify early to build hype for the album and getting income for a (slightly) longer period, but risking casual fans being done with the album come release day.
  * Putting it on Spotify on release date so that everyone gets it at the same time, both casual and hardcore fan.
  * Putting it on Spotify a period of time after release date so that the majority of buyers will have it already (assuming a typical album release and not a &#8220;classic&#8221; that will sell for a long time) and Spotify is an additional revenue stream. The risk here is that people who want to preview before buying will simply download illegally and never buy the album.

I genuinely don&#8217;t know which option is best, but I suspect it&#8217;s not the middle-one.

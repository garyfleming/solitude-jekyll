Move over, Google! I&#8217;ve recently been looking at [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com), and realised how insanely powerful it is. It has a bewildering array of options (thesauras, regex, soundex functions and more), and a highly up-to-date index.

While it&#8217;s ranking algorithm might not be as good as PageRank, it certainly makes up for it in the amount of things you can do with it. I hope the <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> documentation goes up soon, I&#8217;d seriously consider using it for my site search.

I&#8217;ll also soon be loading my entire archive into their system (via <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>), which will make an interesting off-site back-up.

Anyway, good work and good luck to those at Feedster.

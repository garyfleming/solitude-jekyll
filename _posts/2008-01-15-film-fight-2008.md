A few things have bothered me about my film reviews over the last few years. While the format of Film Fight is broadly what I want, in that it allows me to sum up the year in films in fairly handy units, it does have more than a few flaws.

Because it&#8217;s at least a month between watching some films and writing that month&#8217;s Film Fight, some of the spark for the film is gone. I lose enthusiasm and I fear that my reaction, my writing, gets slowly watered down by further comparing films and analysing them. That&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing, films should stand up to scrutiny over time, but
  
I also want to capture that initial reaction a little better.

Additionally I&#8217;m more than aware that my timeliness with updates can be pretty poor. That&#8217;s due, in part, to the fact that writing all the reviews at the end of the month can seem like a burden at times (though one that, ultimately, I enjoy taking on). I&#8217;d like to get some feedback out there more quickly.

To that end, I&#8217;m trialling mini-reviews on [my Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/garyfleming "Twitter updates for Gary Fleming"). As with all Twitter updates, they&#8217;re limited to 140 characters so that should make for timely updates that capture my feelings toward a particular film. I&#8217;m also adding #FF08 to each update, as a [hashtag](http://hashtags.org) which should come in useful at some point.

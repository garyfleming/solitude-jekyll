Since Channel 4 seem incapable of advertising anything I&#8217;ve ever been waiting for them to screen (for example, the American Gothic re-runs), I shall take it upon myself to point out that the newest Derren Brown special is on in 20 minutes. Only spotted because of sheer fluke.

It&#8217;s called The Heist, and the boy wonder is planning on convincing people to rob a bank. You just know he&#8217;ll succeed, but it&#8217;s the frightening ease with which he does things that makes him so entertaining.

Go! Watch!

<ins>Update: Terrifying. Definitely worth a watch on the next repeat, or when the torrents appear in about an hours time.</ins>

<ins>Update 2: Might I suggest that the huge number of people arriving on this post looking for a torrent try somewhere else that might have it like <a href="http://www.uknova.com">UKNova</a></ins>

The rest of the links from yesterday&#8217;s batch. It seems that all the flash games and fun stuff ended up in the other lot:

  * **[Brain In Dish Can Fly Plane](http://www.spacedaily.com/news/robot-04zm.html)** &#8211; Those crazy scientists have done it again, creating a brain capable of flying simulators out of rat brain mush.
  * **[Guide To Bash](http://www.deadman.org/bash.html)** &#8211; Learn more about the Bash shell.
  * **[Bring On The Tables](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200410/bring_on_the_tables/)** &#8211; If you need to use a table (semantically), then this is how to do it properly.
  * **[Pure <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> Scroll Table](http://www.imaputz.com/cssStuff/bigFourVersion.html)** &#8211; And this is how to make it look good and take up little space. Very nice.
  * **[Hallmarks Of A Great Developer](http://blogs.msdn.com/micahel/archive/2004/06/16/157202.aspx)** &#8211; Traits that separate the good and the great.
  * **[<acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> to DivX](http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/dvd2divx_anamorphic.cfm)** &#8211; I&#8217;m sure this conversion guide will come in handy sometime.
  * **[Thinking Machine](http://turbulence.org/spotlight/thinking/index.html)** &#8211; Java chess game that visualises the computer opponent&#8217;s thinking. Purdy.
  * **[Zen Garden 132](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=132%2F132%2Ecss)** &#8211; Very nice looking Zen Garden submission.
  * **[Starting A Label](http://www.indiecentre.com/category.cfm?CategoryID=0)** &#8211; A lot of useful information for starting your own record label.
  * **[Project Cryo](http://metku.net/cryo/)** &#8211; Put a frozen lego-man inside your mouse.
  * **[iPod BMW](http://www.apple.com/ipod/bmw/)** &#8211; For the rich only, but hella cool.
  * **[Fear And Loathing Campaign](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/6562575)** &#8211; Hunter S. Thompson analyses the election run up. A bit late, but still funny.
  * **[Languid](http://languid.cantbedone.org/)** &#8211; Samples text to guess the language. Seems to be fairly reliable.
  * **[Silktide SiteScore](http://sitescore.silktide.com/)** &#8211; Gives your website a score based on various things. Not sure I agree with a lot of the criteria, but interesting anyway.
  * **[Thinking With Type](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/)** &#8211; A very handy resource for typography types.
  * **[Was Darwin Wrong?](http://www.ironcircus.com/blog/000267.html)** &#8211; National Geographic pose a hell of a question, and the answer is a good one.
  * **[Cornell Note Taking System](http://www.crazycolour.com/os/notetaking_04.shtml)** &#8211; Very nice system for note taking. If only I had heard of it a few years ago.
  * **[Grand Theftendo](http://forevergeek.com/games/grand_theftendo_port_of_gta_iii_to_8bit_nes.php)** &#8211; Stunning port of GTA3 to the NES. I want to play.

Hopefully that&#8217;s the last of the links for a good while.

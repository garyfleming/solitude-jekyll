This month&#8217;s film fight is another full four-way.

First, we have Tim Burton&#8217;s remake of the classic **Charlie and the Chocolate Factory**. Where to start? The vision of Willy Wonka is nowhere near as strong as the original. Where Gene Wilder was a magical, musical, but weary showman, Depp is a slightly disturbed and frightened boy who never really grew up. It seems that the modern take on the story had to include parental issues, rather than just being tired of a world that doesn&#8217;t care for the joys in life. It&#8217;s still enjoyable, and has some absolutely hilarious moments, it seems a little sad that the point has been missed.

Comedy comes in the form of **The Wedding Crashers**. A double team of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson meet a fairly dysfunctional family at a wedding and hilarity ensues (yes, it can be summed up that glibly). It is, however, excellent. So many spot-on comic moments, and so many perfectly played characters, including Christopher Walken&#8217;s family figure/senator.

As mindless trashy entertainment, **The Island** is a strong film. Take it any more seriously than that and it all falls apart, with plotholes everywhere, terrible acting, bad plot devices, terrible direction, stuff that just doesn&#8217;t make sense etc.

Finally, in **Crash** we have manipulative and stereotyped attempt at producing an indie film feel with a bunch of Hollywood A-list actors. While it does ask some interesting questions, it does come off as a bit convenient, rather than clever, that all the characters intersect one another.

The winner this month, then, is Wedding Crashers.

P.S. If this seems a bit rushed, it&#8217;s because it was.

P.P.S. I&#8217;m probably not going to do a music post for August. In September, buy the new [Reuben](http://www.wordsfromreuben.com) album. They&#8217;re the best British band in decades.

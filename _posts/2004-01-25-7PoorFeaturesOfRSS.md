[Dylan Greene](http://www.dylangreene.com/) is discussing the [7 must-have features of <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>](http://www.dylangreene.com/blog.asp?blogID=364). I disagree with most.

  1. **Authentication** &#8211; RSS uses http authentication, if you want it. If you don&#8217;t need it (as in most cases), it is bloat.
  2. **Query Standard** &#8211; Outside of the scope of a simple syndication standard, and certainly not a &#8220;must have&#8221; for mainstram use.
  3. **Content Standards** &#8211; I agree on this.
  4. **The Name** &#8211; The name is fine. Call it the more generic &#8220;syndication&#8221; is you must.
  5. **Ad Standard** &#8211; Hardly a must have and a bit of a pipe dream. Ads will never be standardised, because that makes them easy to filter.
  6. **DRM and encryption** &#8211; Avoid proprietary cludges? Not going to happen. The corporations will put in whatever they like, regardless.
  7. **Attachment Standard** &#8211; It already exists but is never used.

I doubt very much whether the average web browser cares about any of those things, or what effect they will have.

Taking a lead from [Steal These Buttons](http://gtmcknight.com/buttons.html) and the new [online button maker](http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/), I&#8217;ve added a [buttons page](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Buttons.php) to this site.

For the most part, it&#8217;s utterly useless. But maybe you&#8217;ll find something remotely interesting in there. I doubt it though.

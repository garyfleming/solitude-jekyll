The second part of yesterdays link-o-rama:

  * **[The Scourge Of Arial](http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html)** &#8211; The history of Arial, and its borrowing of Helvetica,
  * **[How To Spot Arial](http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsid.html)** &#8211; How to tell Helvetica and Arial apart. For obsessives and typographers only,
  * **[4096 Colour Wheel](http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html)** &#8211; A colour wheel that demonstrates the difference between websafe, websmart and pure hex colours. The difference is quite pronounced,
  * **[Gameboy Advance Car Tuner](http://features.evolutionm.net/newsitem/67)** &#8211; Turn your Gameboy Advance into a logger for an engine tuner. People go to some stupid lengths to show off,
  * **[MUTE file sharing](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/19/1750250)** &#8211; A new file sharing program that works anonymously. Although, I very much doubt this will last,
  * **[Link blogs in <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>](http://web-graphics.com/mtarchive/001115.php)** &#8211; Use link blogs provided by [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) in a PHP powered site. I&#8217;ll be looking into this,
  * **[Enemy Of Progress](http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/index.html)** &#8211; An alternative view of Lord Of The Rings, with a discussion of Romaticism versus progressive society. Kinda turns the world on its head,
  * **[<acronym title="Xhtml Friends Network">XFN</acronym>](http://gmpg.org/xfn/)** &#8211; A way of creating a semantic network of friends using standard <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> mechanisms. Way too much work, I&#8217;d rather do this implicitly,
  * **[Illuminopoly](http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Illuminopoly.html)** &#8211; Alternative rules for Monopoly that focus on mind control. Seems quite interesting. I particularly like the various winning conditions,
  * **[Rise Of The Spammers](http://www.securityfocus.com/guest/24043)** &#8211; They&#8217;re getting very serious. Spamming is big business these days,
  * **[Plain English Campaign](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/plainenglishguide.html)** &#8211; A guide to using English in a formal, yet accessible way.

And that&#8217;s that for a few days. I&#8217;ll be back before Christmas.

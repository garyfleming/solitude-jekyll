I told myself I&#8217;d leave the markup for this site alone for a while, but I found myself unable to not correct a previous over-sight. While the main navigation list for this site uses, and always has used, proper list markup, I noticed that the syndication list (blogtree, xml, GeoURL etc) does not. How this one slipped past, I don&#8217;t know.

If you&#8217;re getting any weird effects (things should look _exactly_ the way they did before), then press ctrl and F5 together. That should clear things up nicely.

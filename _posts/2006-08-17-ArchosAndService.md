A few weeks ago, my beloved [Archos AV420](/Archives/2005/08/16/Archos) died, for no good reason. The screen looked fine, the hard drive didn&#8217;t make any funny sounds, it just stopped working. I&#8217;m so used to having it as an mp3 and video player, and as the hub of the tv/hi-fi set-up, that it was looking near unbearable not to have it; I&#8217;d need to get a new one.

Imagine my panic when I realised I had purchased it around 1 year before (the standard manufacturing warranty in the UK for electrical goods), and couldn&#8217;t remember whether it was just short of a year or not. A two day search through my flat and my parent&#8217;s house finally turned up the all important receipt: it had failed 5 days before the warranty was up. Phew!

The next part, I imagined, would be difficult: getting Curries Digital in Glasgow to accept a receipt from Dixons Tax Free in Heathrow (a now semi-defunct part of the same chain), for a not uncostly electrical device that just happened to die under the years warranty. Nothing could be further from the truth.

A brief wait for customer services, a quick explanation of the situation, and cursory glance at the device and I was told immediately that they&#8217;d buy it back off me for the original price. I could, if I wished, go for a different model and pay or receive the difference, or get a full refund if none were to my satisfaction; barely a question asked. That&#8217;s the kind of sensible, straight-forward service we should be getting everywhere.

I had been thinking about replacing the 20Gb hard disk anyway, so I opted to pay a small difference to upgrade to the newer [Archos AV560](http://www.archos.com/products/tv_centric/av_500/): a better looking device, with triple the hard disk space. Of note is the larger, slightly wider screen, a vastly improved operating system, better accessories (the mini-cam add-on looks interesting), the inclusion of a <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> host port (so you don&#8217;t need a computer to transfer between it and other USB devices), and a slightly better battery. Absolute bargain.

The downsides of this model are an ill-fitting leather case (stretched at the seams), a poorer TV hub (the device doesn&#8217;t dock, as before), and a few questionable UI widgets (primarily the playlist control which was never very good).

All in all, I&#8217;m very happy with both Curries handling of this, the additional warranty and the device itself.

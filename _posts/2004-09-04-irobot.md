As everyone should know by now, this film has almost nothing to do with the classic book. It does have the most bold product placements yet to be seen in cinemas; the first twenty minutes are nothing but adverts.

Couple that with cheap plot devices (the winking), poor action scenes (oh, monkey robots), and predictable outcomes (yes, let&#8217;s get a nice long shot of that vital neural net and make sure everyone understands that it runs **everything**). Poor, poor, poor.

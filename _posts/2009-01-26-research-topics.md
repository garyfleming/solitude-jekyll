I&#8217;m curious about something. Actually, I&#8217;m curious about a number of things and that, inadvertantly, is the topic of this post:Â  I&#8217;m curious as to whether or not other computing scientists/software engineers keep an active list of research topics that they want to delve into further.

For years now I&#8217;ve had a series of nagging questions on different topics that I want to answer. Sometimes they&#8217;ll be generally understood problems that I want to know more about (like recommendation systems, a topic I looked at a while back), sometimes they&#8217;ll be new problems that are just opening up and actually need people to move them along (like lifestreams, a topic I fully intend on coming back to). These, broadly, form &#8220;research topics&#8221;: things I want to know more about or explore in some way.

I tend to track these topics in two ways: 1) I simply let them drift in and out of my head. If I find that they keep coming back, then I give them some thinking time and see what falls out. 2) I keep a list of active topics and questions at hand at all times (actually stored on my mobile as a draft text message), which I look over periodically. You&#8217;ll note that I&#8217;m not necessarily actively pursuing anything, just thinking over the topics and seeing if any new information I&#8217;ve come across in the time since I last looked at the topic has shed any new light on the matter.

By using my research topics as sieves for the huge swathes of information I&#8217;m exposed to, I passively manage to form a greater understanding of things that matter to me without wasting time on deadends. I&#8217;ve found that these methods help me find items that I&#8217;m interested in over the medium to long term, rather than picking up and following fads (I deal with current trends in a different way).

The problem is that I find this to be a little too passive at times. I&#8217;m painfully aware that my open source work (which I&#8217;ve mostly done anonymously, but you can find it if you really try) and privately posted projects have all but dried up in the last year or so. I don&#8217;t have a huge amount of free time, and the time I do have I use pursuing other interests. I think I should, however, get back into more active research and produce more product from it, whether that product is code or merely more concrete ideas.

I guess, in a shortened form, my questions are: do people have their own research topics and how do they pursue them? Relentlessly or passively? Soaking them in or furiously chasing them? I&#8217;m curious to know.

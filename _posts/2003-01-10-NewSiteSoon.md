Welcome to my new site. No, it&#8217;s not the site that I&#8217;ve been building for months now; it&#8217;s the one that I&#8217;ve spent the last day or so building. Don&#8217;t expect too much from it. It&#8217;s primary function is to enable me to update people on various projects, including my new site. It&#8217;s more of a blog-style mini-site. As it&#8217;s early days, it will have a bug or two. Should you spot one, please [contact me](/Contact.php) and it will be fixed. Keep coming back for more.

Yes, that&#8217;s right. The brand spanking new VKPS.co.uk will be rocking your world in the shortest time imaginable. A new design, new features, new structure, updated more frequently. This version will be the ultimate version. Until the next one at least.

Given a primary location that is roughly the size of a portaloo, you wouldn&#8217;t think _&#8220;Phone Booth&#8221;_ could be very interesting. Of course, throw in the other key ingredient of the film, a sniper aiming at the occupant of the phone booth who starts picking off nearby people, and you&#8217;ve got a considerably more interesting prospect.

The small location doesn&#8217;t detract from tension, drama, or even characterisation. We get to see the inner workings of Stu (Colin Farrell), and the mysterious sniper (Keifer Sutherland). Although Stu isn&#8217;t the best of people (he&#8217;s an asshole), we can still feel for him; trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare, being instructed by a madman who can play God with his life.

I don&#8217;t want to say too much more (I try not to ruin films for others), but it&#8217;s definitely worth seeing.

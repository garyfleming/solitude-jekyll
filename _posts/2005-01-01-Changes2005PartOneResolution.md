Good new year, everyone? Excellent. Another year, another chance. You&#8217;ll (hopefully) be seeing a few changes around Solitude over the next few weeks, which I&#8217;ll dicuss slightly in the next post or two.

Let&#8217;s begin the new year with that most laughable of traditions, the list of resolutions:

  * **Keep my previous resolutions**. Managed to keep half of last years.
  * **To tangibly make the world a better place**. As should be somewhat apparent from my previous posts on [apathy](/Archives/2004/12/26/EndOfYear2004PartOneApathy) and [changing the world](/Archives/2004/12/29/EndOfYear2004PartTwoTransmute), I&#8217;m not completely happy with the amount I give back to the world. I will try to do more.
  * **To release more software**. There are several ideas waiting on my to-do list, some of which have been there for over a year. I will make time to start at least one of them.
  * **Improvements to Solitude**. The Solitude to-do list is huge in itself. Doing anything on the list would be a step forward.
  * **Finish my degree**. Really, really need to do this one.
  * **Private resolutions**. I have a few private resolutions too.

More on changes to Solitude in the next part.

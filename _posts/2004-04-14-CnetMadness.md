I can&#8217;t say much about how absolutely idiotic the new [CNET syndication format](http://export.cnet.com/html/export/download/dlhtf-download.com.com.xml) is. Mark Pilgrim sums it up best in [Hot <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/14/hot-rss).

Why anyone would rename RSS elements is beyond me. At least Atom is clarifying a lot of the inaccuracy or vagueness of the RSS specs, while providing some new elements.

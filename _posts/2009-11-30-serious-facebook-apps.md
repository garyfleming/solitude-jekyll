The flip-side to my post about [Dopplr being a stand-alone network](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2009/11/29/dopplr-and-networks/), and how that is probably a bad thing is exactly where are all the serious or worthwhile Facebook applications? I can&#8217;t recall ever having seen anything with that isn&#8217;t a novelty of some sort.

Sure, games, quizzes, toys etc can be fun and people are most definitely using them, but are there any applications out there outside of the entertainment/trivia category that are good enough for consumption? I&#8217;m fairly interested by this and what, if anything, it says about preferred usage patterns on social networks.

Is the lack of visibility on non-entertainment apps because they don&#8217;t exist or because people simply don&#8217;t use them? If the former, then is that because the serious app developers don&#8217;t want to cropshare or because they see it as futile? If the latter, is it something inherent in being in front of your friends that causes the lack of interest?

I honestly have no answers here, but I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll see some suggestions made here about what&#8217;s happening, or even showing some good &#8220;serious&#8221; apps.

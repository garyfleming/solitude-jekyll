I have no idea what practical use I could have for this, but Kevin from [Centricle](http://centricle.com/) has added a [favelet that works as a ruler](http://centricle.com/archive/2003/03/ruler).

This is quite cool in that it shows how far favlets can be pushed. Worth messing around with for a while, at least.

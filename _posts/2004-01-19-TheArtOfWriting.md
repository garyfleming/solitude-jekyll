Writing is difficult. Anyone who tells you differently is either lying or has no sense of their own inadequate writing.

Take that last sentence for example. The first section (before &#8220;or&#8221;) is ok, the second poor.

Now look at that last sentence: it is better, with a much shorter, snappier second clause.

Finally, look back. The previous is weaker; using lazy words.

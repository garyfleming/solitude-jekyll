Via [Simon Willison](http://simon.incutio.com) comes a link to a [religious tract called &#8220;Squatters&#8221;](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1019/1019_01.asp).

Wow.

I&#8217;m totally awed by this strip (in the sense that it is mind-numbingly shocking). It&#8217;s like catching your boss fuck a carrot on your lunch break. Words can&#8217;t describe it. Featuring Vatican conspiraces, evil arabs, World War 3 and other insanity. Nuts.

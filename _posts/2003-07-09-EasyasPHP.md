Have they made upgrading [<acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>](http://www.php.net) easier without telling anyone? Last time I attempted it, it took an hour of fiddling with ini settings and my apache config to get precisely nowhere. I did a rollback immediately.

Yesterday, however, I dropped in 4.3.1, modified 2 ini settings and was done in less than 5 minutes. Majorly impressed by how it has smoothed out.

In other news, the first beta of PHP 5 is out. Looks like a lot of improvements to the class structures (private and protected methods and values, abstract classes) and not a lot else. Still, worth watching.

Twelve film fights later and we&#8217;ve got another finale. As always, [my caveat from earlier years still applies](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2012/12/31/film-fight-2012-finale/): Film Fight is done in a knock-out style and, as such, only picks my favourite film of the year; there are no guarantees about second place.

First up, the films that were good but that did not win their month i.e. the honourable mentions:

  * Lincoln
  * Zero Dark Thirty
  * Robot and Frank
  * Compliance
  * Trance
  * Mud
  * The Iceman
  * World War Z
  * This Is The End
  * The East
  * The World&#8217;s End
  * Monster&#8217;s University
  * Kick-Ass 2
  * Filth
  * How I Live Now
  * Machete Kills
  * Captain Phillips
  * Anchorman 2

Then the monthly winners:

  * January: **Django Unchained**
  * February: **Wreck-It Ralph**
  * March: **Cloud Atlas**
  * April: **The Place Beyond the Pines**
  * May: **Upstream Color**
  * June: **Much Ado About Nothing**
  * July: **Pacific Rim**
  * August: **Lovelace**
  * September: **The Way, Way Back**
  * October: **Prisoners**
  * November: **Gravity**
  * December: **The Hunger Games: Catching Fire**

The winners, as a whole, don&#8217;t seem quite as high-quality as some other years, but there are some absolutely fantastic films in there. **The Place Beyond the Pines** is a powerful look at privilege and family ties. **Upstream Color** is a wonderfully hypnotic piece of story telling that pulls off its dreamy feel far better than similar films. In **Pacific Rim** we have the monster movie done well: the story is nonsense but the fights are fun and have weight, despite being CG. **Lovelace** has two of the best lead performances of the year. While **Gravity** is spectacular visual storytelling, gripping throughout.

The winner, though, as predicted back in June, is Joss Whedon&#8217;s take on **Much Ado About Nothing**. It&#8217;s suitably breezy, funny, delightful, wonderfully shot, and rammed full of excellent performances. This is an absolute masterclass on making Shakespeare feel relevant today, without dumbing down the source material. A well-deserved win.

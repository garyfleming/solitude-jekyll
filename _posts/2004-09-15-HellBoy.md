The advantage that comic book to film conversions have over less conventional comic-style films is a rich backstory on which to draw both characters and scenarios. The disadvantage is that writers have to maintain a coherent storyline from such a wide source, while preferably keeping fans happy. This is the downfall of **Hell Boy**.

There are so many characters, interactions and plot details obviously lifted from the comic books that are either dealt with incidentally or completely skimmed over that, to someone who isn&#8217;t familiar with the material, it comes across as a sham of a film with no substance. This is a shame because there is obviously a good film in there, if only it had been better focussed. A shame.

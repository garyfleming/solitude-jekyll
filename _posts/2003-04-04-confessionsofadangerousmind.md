[Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind](http://www.ifilm.com/confessions/) is an odd film. Beginning as the tale of real game show creator, [Chuck Barris](http://chuckbarris.thegongshow1976.com) , it starts to deviate from reality. Or does it?

Although nothing has been (or will be) confirmed in reality, it&#8217;s unlikely that Mr Barris was really a <acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> trained assassin. But because the question can&#8217;t be answered, it reminds me somewhat of [Adaptation](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Archives.php?ArtID=20030308230633).

Both films begin to blur the reality that we are faced with in the cinema. &#8220;Is what we are seeing real or is it fiction?&#8221; is no longer the question. It&#8217;s what _pieces_ really happened and which didn&#8217;t. With more than a hint of truth in every lie, it&#8217;s hard to tell the exact concentration of reality we&#8217;re seeing.

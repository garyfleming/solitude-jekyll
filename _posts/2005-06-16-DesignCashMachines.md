I&#8217;m off to see a few bands later and figured that, yes, it may actually require money to both get there and get into the venue. Where could one, at 6 in the evening, find a source of money? Surely my local branch would be shut! Then I remembered that cash machines were invented nearly 40 years ago.

Putting my card into the macine I was given a fairly smart UI prompt that I&#8217;d never seen before: &#8220;This machine is currently unable to vend 10 notes. If you still wish to continue, input your PIN&#8221;. Letting the user make an informed choice before they have to piss around with the rest of the options is a good idea. Very nice.

One PIN later and I picked the &#8220;Withdraw Cash&#8221; option. I was somewhat dismayed with what I saw on the next screen. The options included:

  * &#163;10
  * &#163;30
  * &#163;50

And how are you going to allow those options? Hmm? You&#8217;ve no tenners.

UI design hint 3: _Don&#8217;t offer options to the user that you can&#8217;t provide_, particularly when you&#8217;ve already explicitly told the user that. What a waste of an earlier smart prompt.

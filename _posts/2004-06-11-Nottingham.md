I&#8217;m going to be busy the next few days, so I&#8217;ll explain the lack of updates that will appear over the next month or so now: I&#8217;m moving to Nottingham.

I&#8217;m taking a year out of university to work for a BigCo who have offices in Nottingham. I don&#8217;t know anyone there, never lived on my own before, and can&#8217;t cook: should be interesting.

So, as of Thursday coming, updates will be sporadic at best until I can get a new computer down there. Stick around though, lots of good stuff planned.

A new toy for you all: [ActoRss](/Code/ActoRss). It generates <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds for any actor available on [IMDb](http://us.imdb.com).

The idea for this came when I recently wondered what Steve Buscemi was working on. Rather than going and finding out, I&#8217;d prefer to be told. And along came ActoRss.

If you want to make <del>stalking</del> <ins>following</ins> Liv Tyler easier, just go to the spangly new [Liv Tyler RSS feed](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Code/ActoRss/?Name=Liv+Tyler).

Enjoy.

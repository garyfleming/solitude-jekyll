As if to justify [my decision to move from long posts to longer Twitter reviews](/2018/01/film-fight-2018-history-and-future/), there are nine films for the first month of the year.

### Jupiter's Moon

### The January Winner

There were lots of interesting films and good options for January, but I think
the winner is **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri**. The world here is
that of a film, but everything fits the template so well that it doesn't
matter.

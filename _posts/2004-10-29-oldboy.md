Korean cinema has been getting more interesting recently (or maybe it&#8217;s just getting more attention). **Oldboy** continues the trend of minimal dialogue, highly stylised Asian cinema with something to say.

The story is decent: a man is kidnapped and left in solitary imprisonment for 15 years. Waking up on a rooftop, he begins the search for revenge and the reasons behind his incarceration.

It&#8217;s got the style, it&#8217;s got a fairly solid plot, direction is not at fault. There are faults though. The hypnosis sub-plot was entirely unnecessary and could have been handled through less jarring means. The pacing was sloppy towards the end; the film should have ended before the final scene (cutting out when the elevator doors close). Apart from that though, a good film. Certainly worth your time.

There&#8217;s not a lot to be said about **Tears Of The Sun**. The action is weak qualitatively and quantitively, with little plot and less acting to back them up. Waving such flags as &#8220;soldier does the right thing&#8221;, and &#8220;do the mission, whatever it takes&#8221;, it does a poor job of actually making you care. When people die, you shrug and go back to sleep.

Dull, mediocre (at best), superficial junk. Don&#8217;t see.

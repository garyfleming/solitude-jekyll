Happy New Year to you all. I wasn&#8217;t planning on doing a 2006 best of, but when trying to wrap up the year quickly and move on, what could be better? Onwards:

  * **Best Album of 2006** &#8211; This is tricky as I bought far more albums from prior years than albums actually from 2006. I will probably go for &#8220;Mcluskyisms&#8221;, the retrospective by now defunct Welsh band, Mclusky. Featuring 3 <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym>s (don&#8217;t go for the one disc version) of mad, great rock, you can&#8217;t pass it up. I suspect had I gotten the Yourcodenameis:milo collaboration album, &#8220;Print Is Dead, Vol. 1&#8221;, earlier then it might have stood a chance. If you ignore the awful collaboration with Lethal Bizzle, the rest seems to be gold.
  * **Best New Band** &#8211; This is the best band I heard last year and easily goes to Kinesis. Sadly, they have split but left a masterpiece in &#8220;You Are Being Lied To&#8221;; sounding like the rock album the Smashing Pumpkins never quite managed. Got their earlier album for Christmas (thanks, Jen!) and that is also sounding pretty good, need a few more listens though. Also quite liking what little I have heard of Piano Bar Fight. Reminds me of the more thoughtful Idlewild moments, with Morrisey like vocals (as distinct from lyrics).
  * **Worst Split** &#8211; I can&#8217;t immediately think of any bands that I wished had made at least one more album. I would say Drive Like You Stole It, but they actually split in August 2005. I&#8217;m pretty sure I didn&#8217;t notice until Spring.
  * **Best Use of Michael Caine** &#8211; Since William Fichtner went to TV this year (only really featuring in the woeful Ultraviolet), the best usage award is for Michael Caine: everyone&#8217;s favourite Michael Caine impersonator. This year he actually did some acting! While his character in The Prestige was decent enough, he was delightful in Children of Men as a playful hippie. Really good stuff there from Alfonso Cuaron.
  * **Best book I read this year** &#8211; The sublime Catch 22, by Joseph Heller. While it&#8217;s now one of my favourite books, it was a bit of a non-event since it was the only book I read in 2006. Yes, that is an abysmal effort, and one I&#8217;ve already taken steps to rectify this year. It&#8217;s not that I wasn&#8217;t reading at all, just that it was mostly online: thousands of articles, covering technology (of course), neuroscience, cognition, perception, religion, economics (a growing interest), and lots of other bits and pieces.

Compare and contrast with the [2005 awards](/Archives/2006/01/03/Solitude2005Awards "the 2005 Solitude awards") to realise the world is a very samey place. I will hopefully increase my post count in 2007, after a fairly dry 2006. That&#8217;s what we always say though.

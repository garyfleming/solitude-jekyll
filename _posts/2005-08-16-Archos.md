I was recently going to join the cult and buy an iPod, but then I saw the [Archos AV4320](http://www.archos.com/products/prw_500664.html) and knew it was what I wanted. So what&#8217;s it packing?

  * A very good L<acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym> screen (clear and crisp).
  * Miniscule start-up time (good for what is essentially a stripped down computer).
  * Video recording stuff (including a cradle to hook it up to the TV).
  * Fairly intuitive UI.
  * It&#8217;s small.
  * A day&#8217;s battery. The battery has only cut out once on me, and that was after a full day&#8217;s use and then hours loading stuff onto it.
  * Video and audio playback and recording (it has it&#8217;s own mic and a selection of inputs and outputs that can be used with the correct wires).
  * The easiest firmware update I&#8217;ve ever seen.

All the good stuff you&#8217;d want in a pocket video and MP3 player. Downsides?

  * No AC3 support, making watching some videos impossible.
  * Default headphones are shite. Really bad. Thankfully, I have a nice pair of Sony Fontopia. If you get one, bin the headphones immediately.
  * The built-in speaker is a touch quiet. This probably won&#8217;t matter.

All in all, I&#8217;m happy. The commute to work and back has become a much more pleasant time.

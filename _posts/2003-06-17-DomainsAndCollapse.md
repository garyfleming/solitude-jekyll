Yesterday, I paid my annual bill for hosting (so the site won&#8217;t be disappearing for at least a year). But I also made a sem-major change.

I used to host a site called Frustrated Artist Commune. Other than actually providing hosting and incorporating Finetto for them, I had nothing to do with it. After months of inactivity and absolutely no interest in the site from its owners, I&#8217;ve removed it. It ate a fair whack of server space and was, in effect, dead.

The other thing I&#8217;ve been thinking about is the main domain at [vkps.co.uk](http://www.vkps.co.uk). For months now, it&#8217;s been inactive (other than the [<acronym title="Extended Winer Number">EWN</acronym> namespace](http://www.vkps.co.uk/Publick/EWN/), which takes a fair number of hits to this day). This site was only supposed to be a temporary measure to keep updates going while I worked on the main site. In reality, I focussed any development time on Finetto, which was then incorporated into this site. So really, I&#8217;ve just been working on this site.

Over time, Solitude has evolved into pretty much what vkps was supposed to be: a constantly updated resource, with code, film and music reviews and other essays. So what to do with the main domain? I don&#8217;t really know. Do you?

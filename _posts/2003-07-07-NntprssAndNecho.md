Good news! [Necho](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EchoExample) support has been hacked into the current version of [nntprss](http://www.methodize.org/nntprss). I&#8217;ve just added the hack to my version and it works perfectly.

[The nntprss necho hack](http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/EarlyHackingInNecho) comes from [Semantic Web](http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/). Good job, that man!

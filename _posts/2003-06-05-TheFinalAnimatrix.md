Yesterday, I bought [**The Animatrix**](http://www.intothematrix.com) on <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> (for the very good price of &pound;12). So, finishing off where I started with my [Animatrix Preview](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/News/Index.php?ArtID=20030517231828), here are short snippets on the remaining parts:

  * **Kid&#8217;s Story** &#8211; Tied in loosely to Reloaded, this is how Kid (the boy who bugs Neo in Zion) escapes The Matrix. It&#8217;s got a very visually pleasing style: a dynamic liquid form of anime. Good, and slightly revealing.
  * **Beyond** &#8211; A haunted house story set in the matrix. Blends traditional japanese anime onto subtle 3D backdrops, with slightly westernised characters. Not the best of the bunch, but certainly not the worst.
  * **World Record** &#8211; A story about a sprinter who, through sheer determination, starts to push his way back into the real world. I can&#8217;t describe how the characters look very well: they&#8217;re bizarre, without being too deformed or quirky. Interesting statement on the human spirit.
  * **Matriculated** &#8211; A group of rebels set out to teach a machine why the way is wrong, and to convince it to join their side. Standard anime in the real world, but an abstract Tron-like view in the construct (albeit more colourful).

I recommend the bundle to anyone, even just for Program (the best part).

As always [my caveat from previous years still apply](http:/Archives/2009/12/31/film-fight-finale-2009/): Film Fight is a knock-out tournament and, as such, will only select my favourite film. It makes no guarantees about any other place.

First, good films that didn&#8217;t win their month:

  * Up In The Air
  * A Prophet
  * Precious
  * Shutter Island
  * Kick-Ass
  * Green Zone
  * Predators
  * Toy Story 3
  * Scott Pilgrim Vs The World
  * Cyrus
  * The Other Guys
  * Winter&#8217;s Bone
  * The Social Network

And then the monthly finalists:

  * January: **The Road**
  * February: **A Single Man**
  * March: **Crazy Heart**
  * April: **Crying With Laughter**
  * May: **Four Lions**
  * June: **Rec 2**
  * July: **Inception**
  * August: **The Expendables**
  * September: **Dog Pound**
  * October: **The Town**
  * November: **Let Me In**
  * December: **Megamind**

Last year had a number of really strong contenders as finalists, with only one film sneaking through. Sadly, that&#8217;s not the case with Let Me In, The Expendables, and Rec 2 all getting through when they might not have in another month (possibly Megamind too, but it&#8217;s fun).

That said, there are still a number of very strong choices in there. I&#8217;d strongly recommend the rest, but need to pick out a few.

4th place goes to **Crying With Laughter**, for it&#8217;s dark comedy and bleak look at one man&#8217;s life.

3rd place goes to **Dog Pound**: it&#8217;s such a well-paced film, constantly raising the feeling of menace until the final act unleashes it all at once.

2nd place: I&#8217;ve debated back and forward on this and the first place a few times. I&#8217;ve even switched them around in various drafts of this post, it&#8217;s that close. I think, though, that the second place goes to **Inception**. While many will get stuck on the special effects, which are quite extraordinary, it&#8217;s the storytelling structure that is the real key to this film. Multiple stories, in multiple timeframes, all happening at the same time and interacting with each other; and rarely missing a beat. That&#8217;s an accomplishment on it&#8217;s own. The fact that multiple viewings reveal more, and there are many more stories left untold leave this as a real masterclass in structure.

1st Place: That means that **The Road** is the Film Fight winner for 2010. It&#8217;s bleak, agonising, and quite desolate, but such a strong vision of a world where a man is compelled to protect the only thing that matters to him, his son, and the consequences of being so single-minded. A classic.

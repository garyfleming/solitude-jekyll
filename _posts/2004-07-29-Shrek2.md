While many sequels of late regurgitate the original&#8217;s jokes but louder (see the Austin Powers sequels for a prime example), **Shrek 2** is original and funny. Taking place not too long after the first film, the story doesn&#8217;t feel like a contrivance to get the characters back together for another adventure; a logical extension, rather than an embarrasingly tied together mess.

That&#8217;s enough analysis though. Primarily this is just a fun film to watch, with charm oozing from every perfectly thought out detail (the BK and Starbucks in Faraway land). The parodies and jokes are aimed at all levels, the &#8220;Cops&#8221; scene being particularly memorable.

All in all, a great film, only hampered by the slightly slow middle. Certainly one to see (like anyone won&#8217;t have by now).

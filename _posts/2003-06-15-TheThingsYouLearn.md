Things that I found out in roughly the space of a day:

  1. Bourbon creams (king among biscuits) are better the cheaper they are. A 29p packet outclasses all challengers.
  2. &#8220;That is _not_ a weed &#8211; it&#8217;s a carrot&#8221;, despite looking very weedy.
  3. A friend (admittedly not an extremely close one, but a friend nonetheless) might end up homeless within a week because of another friends procastination.
  4. **Silent Scope Fortune Hunter** might as well be a bank machine. It&#8217;s so easy to take money out in small bursts. Repeat enough times and you have a considerable wad of cash.
  5. If someone says &#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll change those account details for you before you get paid&#8221;, they really mean &#8220;This request will be binned. You&#8217;ll have to try again next month&#8221;.
  6. [Madeleine Stowe](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Stowe,Madeleine) looks somewhat like [Cate Blanchett](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Blanchett,Cate) as a blonde in **Twelve Monkeys**, apparently.

The rest has been removed to protect the innocent.

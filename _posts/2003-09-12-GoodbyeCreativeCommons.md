Given the recent [hassle over creative commons licensing](http://www.mezzoblue.com/cgi-bin/mt/mezzo/archives/000261.asp), I&#8217;ve decided to pull the creative commons license from this site. It&#8217;s just to open to abuse, and misinterpretation.

From this day onwards, Solitude no longer uses a creative commons license. However, I can&#8217;t revoke the license for previous entries. So, entries between me adding the license and entries prior to today (that does not include earlier entries today) are still under the [by attribution, non commercial, share alike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/).

When I find a fairer and safer license, I&#8217;ll use it.

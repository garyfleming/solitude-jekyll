Yes, it has been an inordinately quiet week here. The last push of work in third year, along with the weekend of celebrations following the end, meant that I&#8217;ve been kept rather busy. Which brings us nicely to the subject of this post.

As part of my third year at the University Of Glasgow, I&#8217;ve been involved in building a distributed, topic-driven web crawler in Java, with [Derek](http://www.mrry.co.uk), [Matt](http://www.iratescotsman.com) and two others.

The end result is [TwentyFour24bot](http://www.twentyfour24.com).

There isn&#8217;t much there on the site yet, but I think we&#8217;ll be putting the source up (once we know it is ok to do so), as well as the dissertation.

I don&#8217;t know how interesting the dissertation would be to most people (at 90 pages, it&#8217;s not exactly easy going), but we do outline some of the more interesting aspects of the design: keeping data moving smoothly around a distributed system under heavy load, implementation of politeness constraints for a crawler (a heavily overlooked area &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t find any other papers on this), and relevance algorithms (that don&#8217;t rely on PageRank networks).

It&#8217;s probably not worth reading if you don&#8217;t have an interest in information retrieval, but we&#8217;re all just glad it&#8217;s over (and the website was sitting there, unlinked).

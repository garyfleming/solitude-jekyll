This is just a short post to say that the lack of posts will largely continue. Still in Nottingham, and net access is not freely forthcoming. I&#8217;ve no idea what&#8217;s being going on in the blogosphere (I&#8217;d guess something to do with syndication, some angst from the Live Journal types, and more about how hard <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> is), so I will update a few times this week with film reviews. It&#8217;s not much, but it&#8217;s all I can really get away with for now.

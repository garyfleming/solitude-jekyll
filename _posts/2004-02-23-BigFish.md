From the trailers it is easy to imagine Tim Burton&#8217;s new film, **Big Fish**, as just being more Hollywood fantasy tripe, with about as much depth as [Chicago](http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2003/08/19/Chicago) (how I love that film).

Surprising, then, is the fact that Big Fish is actually quite entertaining.

It&#8217;s not laugh out loud funny, but the tall tales being woven into a bizarre cornucopia of imagery and tangents. The bit parts are fantastically acted, even if Ewan McGregor&#8217;s accent is a little irritating.

A good film, that managed to surpass low expectations.

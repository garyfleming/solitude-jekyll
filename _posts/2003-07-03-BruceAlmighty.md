It&#8217;s not that **Bruce Almighty** is a particularly bad film, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not even that [Jim Carrey](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Carrey,Jim) places the same character that he has in every other film he&#8217;s been in (barring **The Truman Show**). It&#8217;s not even that the assumptious preachy content is overt and irritating&#8230; Actually, maybe it is.

As with all slapstick comedy, it&#8217;s funny in places and sure to make most people smile at some point. But you won&#8217;t be quoting lines from this in a years time, or even a week. Comedy-lite: As a sandwich, compared to something like **Wayne&#8217;s World**&#8216;s steaky goodness.

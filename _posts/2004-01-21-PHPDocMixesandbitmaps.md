More random links, this time of a web/tech persuasion:

  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>Doc](http://www.phpdoc.de/)** &#8211; After being recently impressed by JavaDoc, I thought this might prove very handy. Haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but it looks promising.
  * **[<acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> Behaviours](http://dean.edwards.name/my/)** &#8211; A whole bunch of scripts to make IE behave itself. Could be the way forward now that development has stopped on IE.
  * **[HTTP tracking](http://sourcefrog.net/projects/meantime/)** &#8211; Track users secretly with Etags. Avoid long boring part at the start, before the real exploit comes in.
  * **[Minimise IE flickering](http://www.fivesevensix.com/studies/ie6flicker/)** &#8211; Minimise flicker in internet explorer. Another fix.
  * **[Url2Bmp](http://www.pixel-technology.com/freeware/url2bmp/english/)** &#8211; Converts urls 2 bmps. Similar to Khtml2png, but works on windows.
  * **[Pure <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> tooltips](http://www.madaboutstyle.com/tooltip2.html)** &#8211; Style tooltips for users. This will cause some severe accessibility problems.
  * **[The Behaviour Layer](http://www.digital-web.com/columns/keepitsimple/keepitsimple_2004-01.shtml)** &#8211; More client side scripting.
  * **[Site Mixer](http://www.topfx.com/cgi-bin/mixmaster.cgi)** &#8211; Mixes the content of one site with the design of a site. Odd.

Done.

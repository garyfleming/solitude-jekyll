As my plan for working on both my [UGC cinema listing <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> Feed](/Code/UgcRss/) and [Actors RSS feed](/Code/ActoRss/) has not progressed as well as I had hoped (I haven&#8217;t really started the overhaul yet, by which I mean I haven&#8217;t looked at either in months), it&#8217;s good to see someone else doing something about it. Jonathan Paisley has created an experimental [WAP interface for UgcRss](http://trogdor.dnsalias.net:8009/ugc/). It&#8217;s running over home ADSL so may break, but it seems fairly solid to me. Thanks for that!

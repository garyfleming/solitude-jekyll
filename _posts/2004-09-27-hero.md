After having the martial arts aspects of **Hero** trumpeted, and knowing there was a strong cast (Jet Li and Tony Leung et al), it was with some doubt that I went into the film; it couldn&#8217;t possibly be as good as people said.

One word: beautiful.

Truly a film that uses the medium to its fullest potential. Care has gone into every leaf, the colour of every rock, the splashes of water, and the wardrobe. It is not just the still imagery that is stunning, the kinetic effects are also perfect; water, the breeze, limbs. Harmonious.

That&#8217;s not to say the film is without faults. The story was somewhat lacking and the fight on water scene did nothing but be silly (yes, it&#8217;s ballet, but a poor one).

Those weaknesses do not remove from the visual splendour of the film, and the enjoyment derived simply by watching.

Some more links because today was boring enough to warrant it:

  * **[Yorkie gets more sexist](http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_769300.html?menu=entertainment.latestheadlines)** &#8211; After the rather funny start to the &#8220;It&#8217;s not for girls&#8221; campaign, Nestle take it one step further. Nice,
  * **[American flag screen-saver](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6f7480bf-3dee-4a28-ade1-419f09e2c394&displaylang=en)** &#8211; There&#8217;s nothing I hate more than seeing an American flag flapping in the wind. Not because I&#8217;m anti-American, but it&#8217;s got be the most cliched image of current times. How many films recently have included a random flag blowing in the wind for the sake of &#8220;patriotism&#8221;? It&#8217;s bullshit and it&#8217;s annoying. So, to balance out that mini-rant, you can use that link to download an american flag screen-saver,
  * **[Flag-O-Rama](http://www.totalobscurity.com/mind/flagstore/)** &#8211; I can&#8217;t decide whether this site is a parody or not. Either way, it&#8217;s quite amusing. &#8220;Take that, hippie scum! YEEEEE-HAWWWWW&#8221;,
  * **[Petals falling](http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2003/04/09/the_petal_storm_begins.html)** &#8211; There&#8217;s something quite beautiful about the image on that page. I&#8217;m not sure why, but I like it.
  * **[26 things a perfect guy would do (and other propaganda)](http://maddox.xmission.com/26_things.html)** &#8211; Maddox: Idiot, nutcase or genius? Who knows. Any way, it&#8217;s a funny article. Number 10 is particularly amusing.

That&#8217;s your lot for the day.

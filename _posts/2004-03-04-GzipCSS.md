Using a very simple technique, it is possible to [compress your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>](http://www.fiftyfoureleven.com/sandbox/compress-css-with-php/) files with <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym>.

Following the instructions on that site, and you can cut your CSS files by a large percentage. Good for bandwidth, good for visitors.

However, I would suggest one modification to the code given: do some user-agent sniffing for Netscape 4. Now, normally I&#8217;m not a fan of <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym> specific techniques, but if you don&#8217;t make an exception in this case, the GZip process will crash Netscape 4.

The problem is that it is difficult to target that particular browser. After some careful observation of various similar UA string, I think it is sufficient to not run the compression routine if you find the string `Mozilla/4` but not the string `compatible`.

In addition, I&#8217;ve set up an htacess rule to parse .css files, rather than rename them to .php.

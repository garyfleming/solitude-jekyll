There are certain things you should not attempt to do either drunk or while recovering from a serious night of drinking. These include, but are not limited to:

  * Drinking orange juice. It _will_ go right through you, and that is the last thing you&#8217;ll want to see/smell/experience,
  * Debug 2 apache servers simultaneously. This is not recommended behaviour at any time, but it gets more fun when you can&#8217;t focus on which one you&#8217;re fixing. This leads to more problems and more debugging. Ad infinitum,
  * Install mod\_rewrite. Tracking problems online and offline to find some common ground, to get mod\_rewrite working is NOT fun. Bastarding thing,
  * Watch Sister Act 2. Actually, you should never do this.

There&#8217;s far more that could be added, but for sake of pride, I&#8217;ll leave it at that.

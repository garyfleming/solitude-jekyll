[Live Bookmarks](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html) are a new feature in the FireFox 1.0 candidate release. It basically lets you view an <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feed is a folder of bookmarks, updating as the site updates. Very clever idea, decent implementation too.

However, to [claim it is a browser innovation](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/14/liveBookmarks) is wrong. Internet Explorer has been doing the exact same thing with <acronym title="Channel Definition Format">CDF</acronym> feeds for an age. As long as the MIME type is being served correctly, clicking on a link to a CDF file adds it as a live folder in bookmarks.

Clever, but now new.

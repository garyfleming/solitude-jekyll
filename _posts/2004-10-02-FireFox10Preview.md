Having installed [Firefox 1.0 PR](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) recently on Windows and Linux, I have to say how much I&#8217;m impressed by it. I think it&#8217;s finally ready for the masses. It automatically, and sensibly, imports various pieces of data from existing browsers (history, bookmarks, etc), and has a completely uncluttered interface.

The sensible approach to updates surprised even me. Firefox checks whether it or any extensions have been updated in the background, and displays a small icon next to the throbber when changes have been made. The actual updating process is a simple click-through dialogue, making having the newest versions of everything trivially easy.

Then there are the extensions themselves. Old favourites like [Mouse Gestures](http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=39) and [tab browser extensions](http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions_modules.html.en) still appear, while new extensions like [FoxyTunes](http://www.iosart.com/foxytunes/firefox/) are proving to be very handy.

Let me just emphasise that: FoxyTunes is incredibly handy! It integrates with most music players (Winamp and iTunes included) to provide controls inside the browser. I can&#8217;t imagine being without it in a browser now.

Finally a release to recommend to non-technical friends.

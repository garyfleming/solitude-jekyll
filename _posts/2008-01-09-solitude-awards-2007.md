As in previous years, let&#8217;s sum up last year with some near meaningless awards that show little change:

  * **Best album of 2007** &#8211; There&#8217;s a fair bit of competition here, mostly niche rock stuff. Although there were solid showings from [Fighting with Wire](http://fightingwithwire.co.uk), [Biffy Clyro](http://www.biffyclyro.com/) and [Reuben](http://www.wordsfromreuben.com/), I think the album I&#8217;ve listened to (and had stuck in my head) most is the lo-fi noise of &#8220;Curses&#8221; by [Future of the Left](http://www.futureoftheleft.com/). It&#8217;s not going to find a big following, but the people it finds will be infected with the sharp vocal hooks throughout. A classic.
  * **Bravest album of 2007** &#8211; While it falters in the opening track and the later track about middleweight boxing in the &#8217;80&#8217;s, JetPlane Landing&#8217;s latest offering, &#8220;Backlash Cop&#8221;, proves to be a unique masterpiece. Leaving the tight rock of their second album behind, the boys from Derry have done what no-one expected of them: a rap-blues-funk concept album about jazz and blues legends. It absolutely should not work, but track after track deliver strong beats, lyrics and tight rhythm.
  * **Best new band** &#8211; no-one. I didn&#8217;t really get into any new bands this year that I can think of. If you want some new stuff, I can recommend most people on [Captains of Industry](http://captainsof.com). My own fault for focussing on bands I already had.
  * **Best Use of William Fichtner** &#8211; The man, the legend. His appearances are growing increasingly rare but he shone as Agent Alexander Mahone, the man sent after the escapees in Prison Break, season 2.
  * **Best Book I read this year** &#8211; Although I don&#8217;t have too much to pick from, I think &#8220;Post Office&#8221; by Charles Buchowski is my favourite. A great read.

A lot of similarities with [the 2006 awards](/Archives/2007/01/02/Solitude2006Awards/ "Solitude Awards 2006") then, but that&#8217;s no great surprise. 2007 seemed like a year for things coming together rather than upheaval. We shall see what 2008 holds.

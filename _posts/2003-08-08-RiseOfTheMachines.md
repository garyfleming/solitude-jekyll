**Terminator 3** surprised me somewhat. It played the mix of action and comedy perfectly: a lot of the former, a smidgen of the latter. Without taking itself completely seriously, it still did a good job of updating the skynet world.

My biggest problem with it is the changed premise (something that should be avoided in any series) which is unconvincingly explained later, particularly given the reasons for pulling the &#8220;happy&#8221; ending from T2 (anyone who has the Ultimate Edition <acronym title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</acronym> can watch it.) It doesn&#8217;t get in the way too much, however.

What I enjoyed most was the action sequences. No clever special effects, no highly stylised martial arts, just robots throwing each other around like the brutes they are. Fantastic.

Worth seeing, especially in anticipation for the inevitable T4.

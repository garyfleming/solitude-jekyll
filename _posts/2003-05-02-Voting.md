I voted for the first time yesterday. It wasn&#8217;t a very overwhelming experience. Nobody that I really wanted to vote for.

What&#8217;s the point in a democracy that does such a poor job of representing the people? As far as I can tell, no party fully represents a single person (other than the party themselves). The normal voters have to pick the closest fit; Everyone compromises and hopes for the best.

Of course, the best never comes. The various political parties don&#8217;t put their real agendas on the table. No sir, can&#8217;t have the people getting what they wanted.

Excuse the cynicism of this post, it just seems that our countries are far from what they could be.

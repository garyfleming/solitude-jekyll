While lacking the usual charm and oddities that are hallmarks of the Coen brother&#8217;s output, this remake of the classic **The Ladykillers** still retains their unique influence. Beginning with some beautiful shots of the settings, this film shows more of the pairs artistic flair than previous (less mainstream) efforts.

Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the odd Professor with the plan to rob a casino, while the supporting actors do an admirable job in the face of his scene-stealing performances. Hanks reels off pages of dialogue, intoned perfectly, without a hint of pausing. Impressive stuff.

The film itself is enjoyable as a lightweight comedy, but lacks the laughs of &#8220;The Big Lebowski&#8221; or &#8220;Fargo&#8221;. Although they should be proud of themselves, remaking such a well-loved film and doing a good job of it is admirable, you can&#8217;t help but miss the strange outpourings of the Coen&#8217;s original works.

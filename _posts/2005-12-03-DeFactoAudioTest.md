After hearing two other stories about this and having done it myself before that, it seems like there is a de facto standard for testing hi-fi and home entertainment systems. It&#8217;s rather simple:

  1. Turn up your equipment as loud as you can, and ramp up the bass.
  2. Whack in a copy of the film **Swordfish**.
  3. Enjoy the madness that is the opening &#8220;human claymore&#8221; scene.

If the ball bearings don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re going past your head and the floor doesn&#8217;t rumble enough to upset the neighbours when the car lands, your equipment isn&#8217;t good enough.

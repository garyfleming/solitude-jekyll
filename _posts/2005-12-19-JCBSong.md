It seems that the excellent [Nizlopi have gotten to number one](http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18122005/325/jcb-song-powers-its-way-top-charts.html). I implore everyone to go and buy a copy of this tomorrow to ensure they get the Christmas number one.

I saw them play in Edinburgh a few months back when I went to see their support band for the night, [Amplifico](http://www.amplifico.net). The show they put on is quite unlike anything else, with a double bass, beatboxing, rapping, and folk music mixed together. After that, go seem that play at King Tuts in January (or wherever your nearest venue on their tour is).

Buy it!

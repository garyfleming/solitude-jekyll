This morning I found out that I&#8217;ve been invited to join the [Tape It Off The Internet](http://www.tapeitofftheinternet.com/) Beta, after signing up months ago. The idea is that it&#8217;ll be the place to go for TV related stuff: whether commenting, leaving information or downloading.

It&#8217;s far too early in the beta to say anything much about it other than it&#8217;s a great idea (<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> feeds and the ability to attach your own torrents to episodes is sadly lacking). Instead, I have 5 invites to give away. If you want one, leave a comment, email my gmail account or find me on msn.

As is normal at this time of year, there&#8217;s not much out that looks worthwhile so I&#8217;ve only seen a few films this month.

First up, **Megamind** is the superhero story we&#8217;ve all wanted to see for a while: the one where the evil villain and his dastardly creations finally win out and defeat the hero. Megamind is about the loneliness of a villain with no hero to fight. From that point onwards, the story is fairly predictable but fun, built around a number of parodies and sight gags. The highlight is probably Will Ferrell&#8217;s Marlon Brando impersonation, but there are a bunch of other neat little moments. It never manages to raise itself to the level of a classic animated film (like Toy Story 3), but is good enough to watch at least once. (See [my Megamind Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/11494207831146497)).

**The Tourist**, however, is not good enough to recommend watching even half of it. It&#8217;s a truly terrible film on almost every level. It looks pretty and has a strong cast, but they&#8217;re squandered here on terrible dialogue and a formulaic, &#8220;twisting&#8221; plot. You&#8217;ll see the twists coming, you&#8217;ll cringe at the ropey lines, the heavy-handed spoonfeeding of information, the seen-it-all-before action set pieces, and the overacting. I can&#8217;t recommend this at all. Terrible. (see [my The Tourist Twitter review](http://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/13607151649951745)).

The winner is **Megamind**. Not because it&#8217;s a classic film, more because it didn&#8217;t have any competition.

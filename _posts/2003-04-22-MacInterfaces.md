In addition to [menus that don&#8217;t work as well as they should](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/20/AnotherKey), I would suggest that Macs have one more fatal flaw in terms of ease of use; although this is one that every Mac user will claim is a feature, rather than a bug.

**One-button mice**, oh how I hate you. Now, I understand the thinking behind only having one button: consistency. No matter where you are on the screen or what you&#8217;re doing, clicking will &#8220;activate&#8221; the object or menu you&#8217;re on. Very nice and simple.

The problem is that I like my right-mouse button; context-sensitivity is _very_ helpful. It works in a generally consistent way. I can largely predict what options I&#8217;ll have quick access to from my mouse when I use it. If a program is unpredictable, then it&#8217;s the programs fault, not the hardware. This is also a very rare case these days. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I was surprised when a right-click didn&#8217;t do exactly what I expected it to do. I have, however, been very annoyed by websites which disable my ability to right-click, and by operating systems which assume that I&#8217;m too dumb to be able to remember a simple menu system.

As long as alternatives remain in menus, then how does offering a second mouse button hinder anyone? Not offering it is hindering at least one person.

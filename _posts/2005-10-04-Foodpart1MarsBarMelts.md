Food. I like it. You probably like it too, everyone does. So a short series on food seems like the right thing. I&#8217;m going to go over a few very unhealthy recipes (that sounds a bit formal for the kind of thing I mean but alas there are no better words), and possibly diverge a bit. To my knowledge (ie from recall, rather than from looking through the archives), this is the first post I&#8217;ve done on food since the ill-fated [omlette incident](/Archives/2003/01/17/Omlette), way back at post number six. Anyway, the best place to start when it comes to food is the dessert.

&#8216;Now&#8217;, you&#8217;re wondering, &#8216;what culinary masterpiece is Gary going to teach us how to make today?&#8217; Today, today, we make mars bar melts. Here&#8217;s how:

  * Buy a Mars bar.
  * Put it in the fridge for a day. You want it to be cold to the touch and rock hard.
  * Unwrap, put it on a plate, and microwave it for 20 seconds.
  * Enjoy! If you&#8217;ve done it right, the chocolate shell should still be relatively solid and the middle should have melted. Warm goo! Nummy.

If you&#8217;ve got any masterworks of the black art of cooking that would make Mr Grossman envious, I encourage you to take this opportunity to post about them. Another, more savoury, treat in a day or two.

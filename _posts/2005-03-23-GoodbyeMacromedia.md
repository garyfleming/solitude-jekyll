A question: if you had a tool which did what you wanted, had a decent interface, some nice features but only worked 95% of the time, would you keep it? That 5% is probably not that much unless it happens to be a tool that you use frequently and for long periods, then the 5% really starts to matter.

[Macromedia](http://www.macromedia.com) Dreamweaver is that tool. For years now, I&#8217;ve been using it (in code viw) to build websites, write <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> and manage web based projects. In the last year or two though, the problems have been mounting up:

  * Huge amount of time to create a new site folder and associated data. It should not take minutes to open up a dialog. A minor nuisance, since new sites are relatively infrequent.
  * Partial function colouring in PHP. Some standard functions get the function call colouring (blue), others don&#8217;t. More than once this has made me second guess the function name.
  * Making .htaccess files incredibly difficult to open. It&#8217;s just a text file, it should not be that hard.
  * Munging data. Because of some angle bracket handling code that has gone horribly wrong, Dreamweaver occassionally changes my data without telling me. What do I mean? Removing the &#8220;less than&#8221; character from a conditional, for example, or taking chunks of what it believes to be <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> away. Unforgivable.

In those same years, I&#8217;ve learned to be far less tolerant of problems with tools because I can generally be certain that the problem is not with me. I&#8217;ve also become fairly proficient with emacs, and my set-up suits me down the ground. I&#8217;m constantly impressed by new extensions tht I find, the commands have become second nature and the minimal interface works. Goodbye Dreamweaver, you should&#8217;ve worked 5% harder.

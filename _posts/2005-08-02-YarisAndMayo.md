You may have noticed a distinct lack of posts for the last few weeks. As mentioned previously, I&#8217;ve been in London. As part of that trip, taken with some very nice people, a list was produced. Not just any list mind, a [quote list](http://www.vkps.co.uk/quotes.txt).

Now, be warned: that&#8217;s probably not safe for work. Also, I take no responsibility for any of the content. It&#8217;s something I said I&#8217;d host for those who wanted to remember the best banter. Ass now covered (but not in Hellman&#8217;s) from a future employer perspective? Hopefully. Enjoy, assuming it makes sense to anyone out of context.

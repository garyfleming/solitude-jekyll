Time for some random links:

  * **[Drop Shadows](http://andreas.web-graphics.com/css-shadow/)** &#8211; <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> drop shadows in most browsers (not <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>).
  * **[Cellular Automata](http://dealmeida.net/blosxom/en/Programming/a_garden_of_cellular_automata)** &#8211; A constantly evolving header graphic, depicting flowers reacting to weather and interacting with each other.
  * **[SScrable](http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/SSCrabble/)** &#8211; A (slightly flawed) single-player scrabble game. Fantastic (and I hate scrabble). Via [Submit Response](http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/).
  * **[Crazy Game](http://www.aquarionics.com/journal/2004/01/30/Crazy_Game)** &#8211; The most insanely difficult but compulsive game of all time.
  * **[When Word To <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> Conversions Get Nasty](http://www.cmswatch.com/Features/TopicWatch/FeaturedTopic/?feature_id=98)** &#8211; An article on converting nasty word docs to XML; a rather large project on its own.
  * **[Ontology, Taxonomy, And Vocabularies](http://www.metamodel.com/article.php?story=20030115211223271)** &#8211; The differences explained.
  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> mag](http://www.php-mag.net/)** &#8211; A decent resource for PHP related tutorials.
  * **[10 Myths Of Copyright](http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html)** &#8211; Some of the more pervasive copyright myths put to rest.
  * **[How To Write Good](http://www.nationallampoon.com/nl/02_fb/writegood/writegood.asp)** &#8211; &#8220;There are many more writing hints I could share with you, but suddenly I am run over by a truck.&#8221; Genius.
  * **[Helicopter game](http://www.hurtwood.demon.co.uk/Fun/copter.swf)** &#8211; Great one button game. Fly a helicopter through a tunnel.
  * **[Definition Lists Explained](http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/definition/)** &#8211; A clear article on the usage of definition lists, with some interesting ideas on how to style them.
  * **[CSS Pencils](http://www.designdetector.com/tips/aboutcsspencils.php)** &#8211; Making images of pencils entirely from CSS. I remember seeing something like this except with images from KnightRider.

That&#8217;s all for another few days.

This is going to be a sizeable, but slightly dated link post, as I&#8217;ve been sitting on some of this stuff for 2 weeks. Enjoy:

  * **[Slice City](http://www.simslice.com/Slicecity.htm)** &#8211; Play Sim City within The Sims. Look at the screenshots and it&#8217;ll make much more sense.
  * **[Googledorks](http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/index.php?module=prodreviews)** &#8211; Some google searches that you can use to get at sensitive information. People really are this stupid.
  * **[MozCC](http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc/)** &#8211; A mozilla extension that allows sites a Creative Commons license to be parsed in the browser. Not a bad idea.
  * **[Poignant Guide To Ruby](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/)** &#8211; Funny, yet informative, guide to Ruby. The best language guide I&#8217;ve seen (there are cartoon foxes everywhere).
  * **[Pronounciation of SQL](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/02/11/pronunciation_of_sql)** &#8211; It all makes sense now.
  * **[Elephant Vs. Bird](http://jeux.com02.com/)** &#8211; Flash game where you need to avoid being squashed.
  * **[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)** &#8211; A tool for autogenerating manuals for code. Works in C, Java, <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> and more. Via [Derek](http://www.mrry.co.uk).
  * **[Seven Steps To Better Presentations](http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000483.html)** &#8211; I&#8217;m going to need this fairly soon. The comments also have some fairly good suggestions.
  * **[Atom <acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym> and Nokia](http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/2004/02/blogging_via_at.html)** &#8211; _The_ mobile phone company looks like backing Atom. Nice.
  * **[Logo Trends](http://www.gdusa.com/feature/4_03/trends.php)** &#8211; Interesting study of logo trends at the moment. Some of the spirals are very nice.
  * **[Compilers Are Easy](http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000304.html)** &#8211; Making writing compilers sound easy. I have my doubts.
  * **[Design patterns and PHP](http://www.daholygoat.com/rants_php_and_designpatterns.htm)** &#8211; Interesting article that suffers from terrible readability.
  * **[Why C Is Not My Favourite Programming Language](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/7/144019/8872)** &#8211; A little harsh, but bang on for the most part. The lack of strings or booleans in C is a constant annoyance.
  * **[Redesigning Comment Forms](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/02/19/form-redesign/)** &#8211; I have always implemented the basics of this, and if I ever get round to adding the ability to remember users I&#8217;ll do the rest.
  * **[Character Encodings](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars.html)** &#8211; Everything anyone ever wanted to know about character encoding issues, and more.
  * **[dotemacs](http://www.dotemacs.de/)** &#8211; A wonderful resource for those new to the worlds of emacs.
  * **[Bush Vs. Palpatine](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/Bush-Palpatine.html)** &#8211; Which of these quotes was said by George Bush and which by Emperor Palpatine. Hint: the worst ones are all Bush.

That&#8217;s all for another day.

I got a strange email from a company in Kuwait recently asking for a quote on stationary and mobile metal analysis devices. At first I thought it might have been some kind of bizarre spam, but the lack of trying to sell me something I didn&#8217;t want suggested otherwise. I put it to one side and forgot about it.

An hour or two later, I checked my referrer log and noticed someone had arrived a day or two earlier from a Google search on &#8220;metal analyser&#8221;. Performing the same Google search, I figured out what had happened.

The company had seen the [Generic Nu Metal Analyser](/Code/GenNuMetal/) in the archives, translated the page badly and thought I was selling metal anaylsers. Whoops, a text analyser was probably not what they had in mind.

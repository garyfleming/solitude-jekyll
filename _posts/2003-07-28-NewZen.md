I have a new favourite [<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com) design: [Hedges](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/031/031.css). Very funky, cartoon-type stuff.

A lot of the new entries are worth a look. Not too take away from the excellent previous entries, but the newer ones seem to be a generation ahead. Good stuff.

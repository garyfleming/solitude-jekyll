Yar, it be another [Talk Like A Pirate Day](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/) (well it will be in 45 minutes). Which, of course, means a very minor redesign.

As the lack of posts around here lately probably show, I&#8217;ve been very busy for the last few months. It&#8217;s been ages since I&#8217;ve had both the time and energy to write something worthwhile. The last series (about my hometown) probably wasn&#8217;t worthwhile, and I wrote literally months ago for a posting drought like this. Oh well. After going to Edinburgh for most weekends in August (ah, the fringe), the usual bunch of September flatwarmings (spread over no less than 7 cities this year), and various other things during the week (my job being one of them), things seem to be quieting down.

If I say here that I&#8217;m going to release my first Greasemonkey script soon and that I&#8217;ll finally write up my fourth year project, then I may actually begin work on either. Or then again, it might be another quiet spell. We shall see.

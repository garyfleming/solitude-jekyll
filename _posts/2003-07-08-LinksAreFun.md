In lieu of actual content, I thought I&#8217;d do one of those entirely links based posts that people are so fond of. Note: there are actually a few pieces of real content waiting to be added, but I thought since I got a decent set of links today, I&#8217;d post them instead.

[Pixie Theory: <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> vs. Necho](http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/archives/echo_rss_and_pixies.php): By thinking of the opposing sides as either pixies or not pixies, we can figure out what side of an argument we should be on. Necho wins, of course.

[BurningBird: I remember usenet](http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001328.htm): <acronym title="America Online">AOL</acronym> is coming for weblogs. As any right thinking individual knows, this is the first sign of the apocalypse.

[Be A Grafitti Artist](http://www.nothing-sacred.net/articles/3/331/): A (partial) return to form for **Nothing Sacred** with this article about how to be a grafitti artist.

[Drop Shadows With <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>](http://nontroppo.org/test/shadow.html): A nice little technique for adding shadows to boxes in CSS.

[Blogshares](http://www.blogshares.com): I finally became a blogshares millionairre today. To celebrate, I devalued the stock for this site by selling a shitload of it; earning myself yet more money. Capitalism is, indeed, fun.

I&#8217;ve been making a few minor changes to the layout of this site. Nothing earth-shattering but, I feel, worth mentioning to the masses.

Firstly, one of the little tricks that I had originally set-up for standards-compliant browsers (almost everything except Internet Explorer) is now working in all major modern browsers (including <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>). Namely, the BlogTree, xml and ScotsBlogs buttons above have now got roll-over effects that work everywhere.

Secondly, an alternative style is available for those people whose browsers have a style-switcher (Mozilla, Phoenix etc). To others who don&#8217;t have a browser capable of it, come back on Friday. It will be the only style on that day and that day only (figure out what &#8220;special&#8221; occassion Friday marks and you can probably guess what the new style is like). Don&#8217;t miss it!

Finally, some major back-end work is nearly done.

You may return to something interesting again.

Yes, it&#8217;s another obligatory birthday post (see [last year&#8217;s](/Archives/2004/10/24/ObligatoryBirthdayPost "Birthday post from last year (2004)") and the [one from 2003](/Archives/2003/10/24/RememberAutumnLeaves "Birthday post from 2003") for examples). Last year I said 21 was an interesting age and that it&#8217;d be a good year. I was very right.

It&#8217;s been a very busy year, but also an enjoyable one. I&#8217;ve learned more about the world, people, friendship, the real world (come back, student life, all is forgiven!) and everything else in the last year than I have in any other period of my life. I guess that&#8217;s growing up.

New friends, new challenges, new job, a new band (with new drumkit), and new world view.

Then there&#8217;s the old. For the first time on a birthday, people have been calling me old (I&#8217;m only 22!). I almost feel bad about calling [Matt](http://mattgemmell.com) old all those times&#8230; then I realised he&#8217;ll always be old. Also, I know [Derek](http://mrry.co.uk) has this fun to go through in a year or two, so I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some karmic balance between those two with me in the middle.

It&#8217;s been busy. I can&#8217;t remember a time when I had so much stuff going on. Since starting my job in July, it seems like I&#8217;ve been doing stuff pretty much every day and night. The one or two nights a week I&#8217;m in, I&#8217;m generally too tired to do anything worthwhile, hence the post rate and my creative output in general dropping. Things seem to be settling a bit now, so hopefully that&#8217;ll change.

I&#8217;m not going to make any predictions of where I&#8217;ll be, or what I&#8217;ll be doing this time next year. This last year has taught me that if you just go with things and take risks and chances, you&#8217;ll end up better off. Fortune favours the brave and all that.

Anyway, I&#8217;ll finish with a verse from a song that&#8217;s being going through my head all day:

> Another day down, it&#8217;s another month gone, God knows how many shows, Yeah we still keep moving on and on, But that&#8217;s rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll I &#8216;spose.

We&#8217;ll see how that stands in a year.

Now for something a little different: the [Wario Ware](http://www.warioware.biz/) website is eating my time. To sum it up as a series of 5 second _microgames_ does not do it justice. Each game is a miniworld in itself, devouring time like peasant devours turnip.

The <acronym title="Game Boy Advance"><acronym title="Gigabyte">GB</acronym>A</acronym> version promises over 200 such games. Oh dear; I&#8217;m supposed to be working at some point within the next year.

After recently being delighted by [Archive.org&#8217;s new features](/Archives/2004/04/09/ArchivesAreGood), they&#8217;ve done it again in the form of [FreeCache](http://www.archive.org/web/freecache.php).

It provides a way for content providers with bandwidth limitations to maximise external cache usage. In short, if you want to serve up large files, you save money, your ISP saves money, everyone is happy.

Can&#8217;t wait to see what they do next.

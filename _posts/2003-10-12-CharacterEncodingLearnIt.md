I would normally save this for a random links post, but it&#8217;s far too important for that. Joel has written [the absolute minimum you need to know about unicode and character sets](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html). I personally knew most of it (although UCS-2 was news to me), but I know how important this stuff will be in the future.

Get it learned if you want to work with computers in 10 years time. It&#8217;s really not that hard.

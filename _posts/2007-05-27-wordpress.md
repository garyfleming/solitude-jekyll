Things have been quiet here for the last few months for a number of reasons: moving flat, getting internet back, changing jobs (within the same company), and a bunch of other reasons (some of which I&#8217;ll be mentioning soon).

One of the big reasons for a slowdown in the number of posts is that I&#8217;ve been unhappy with my current content management system, Finetto, for quite some time. It was designed with a fairly limited amount of functionality in mind, primarily to help out a friend who needed a CMS quickly. It was also one of the first big PHP projects I had undertaken, before I really understood the language, and while I was still quite fresh to real programming (I have been programming since I was about 8 but not in a consistent and structured way). The design quickly became messy as more features were required. I could go back and rewrite the whole thing, with some interesting ideas, or I could just enhance an existing product.

In the last month or so, I&#8217;ve taken the time to pull data out of the old CMS and migrate it to everyone&#8217;s favourite CMS, [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). I&#8217;ve been talking about doing this for a while, and one of my long stated goals for any such transition is that it would be functionally seamless for end users. Since I actually switched a few weeks ago and no-one seems to have noticed, I&#8217;ll call that one a success. As an aside, the recent [feed problems](/Archives/2007/05/20/feed-problems/) were not related to the WP switch.

The switch itself was pretty painless. WP is easy to set-up, the design I used on the old CMS was easy enough to convert (using standards-based design helps), and the data was easy enough to migrate on the WP side. The only trick was actually pulling the data out of the old CMS. While it&#8217;s file-system based storage was exceptionally quick, it wasn&#8217;t the easiest to manipulate.

Expect some WP plugins to appear soon.

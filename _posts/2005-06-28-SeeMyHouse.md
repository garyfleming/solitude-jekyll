I&#8217;m not usually one to get [excited over maps](http://mrry.co.uk), but [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com) is fantastic. When it first loaded up I thought it was pretty shit. After a minute or two, Earth suddenly appeared. Interesting. The search bar caught my eye next.

If you give someone a pen to try out, they will write their own name most of the time. Give someone a map, and they&#8217;ll look for their house. I hit search and it slowly zoomed into a brown mushy image. Oh. Great. Then it began resolving. The first holy shit: that&#8217;s the town centre. A whip along the route to my house slowly started showing up the landmarks I see every day. There it was: my house.

That was good. But, now that it had the data cached, I zoomed out to planet level and did a single click to get it back to my house. My jaw literally dropped as it whapped from planet to house level. Wow.

I pity, truly pity, those who are not lucky enough to have good satellite data for their area such as those people in Glasgow (I&#8217;m actually in the nearby area with data available). Sure, I can&#8217;t think of any really decent uses for it. Sure, I&#8217;ll get bored of it sometime soon. As toys go though, it&#8217;s pretty fun to play with.

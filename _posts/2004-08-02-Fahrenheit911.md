Another documentary from the now infamous director Michael Moore, **Fahrenheit 9/11** discusses American internal security issues after the twin tower incident several years back.

Despite being somewhat informative and, in places, frightening, the main points are made through conspiracy theory-like circumstantial evidence and conjecture. Certainly the points made stand up (why were the Saudis allowed to freely leave the country when no-one else could?) but the reasons given are based on relatively flimsy evidence.

The tone of the film is also more patronising than should be expected from a serious documentary, dumbing everything down to the point of childishness.

It still remains a watchable film, but not one to be taken as absolute truth.

While poor sequels tend to re-use plot devices from their predecessors with a large and obvious wink, **The Bourne Supremacy** does a much better job of keeping previous plot lines alive while not being cretinous.

The story itself revolves around an assassination and fit-up that bring Jason Bourne back out of hiding. It&#8217;s as predictable as most Tom Clancy style books (Robert Ludlum most definitely falls into that category) but with slightly more panache. The fight scenes are slightly clumsier than before, but are reasonably solid.

Here&#8217;s to confident sequels and the inevitable sequel, **The Bourne Ultimatum**.

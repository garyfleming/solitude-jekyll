Those fine young engineers over at Microsoft are trying to edge their way into the search engine space with [<acronym title="Microsoft Network">MSN</acronym> Search](http://beta.search.msn.com/). In attempting to take Google&#8217;s dominance, they need to not only at least match the quality of results, they have to make people want to leave Google. It&#8217;s not sufficient to simply have good links. Google is _the_ search engine. To make people leave it, they have to have some tangible improvement to the user experience.

Their answer? The search builder.

This is a terrible move that will not win them the search war. The problem is that people don&#8217;t want to build up searches, they couldn&#8217;t care less about most of the options presented to them (assuming they took the time to understand them in the first place), they want to [&#8220;type their 1.3 words into the search window and let the search tech do its stuff&#8221;](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/02/23/SearchControls). They won&#8217;t do any more than that.

Google understood that. The UI is as simple as it can be: a textbox and a button. No ambiguity, no ignorable complexity, just the functionality.

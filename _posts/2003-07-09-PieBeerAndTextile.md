First up: How do we feel about [99 bottles of beer in 571 languages](http://99-bottles-of-beer.ls-la.net/)? Programming languages. Yes, someone has created a list of very similar programs in pretty much every language that&#8217;s ever done anything useful (and about 550 others). Too much spare time, but interesting to compare syntax nonetheless.

We now have Necho support in the [feed validator](http://feeds.archive.org/validator/) (formerly the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> validator). It is based on the 1st of July snapshot and, although there have been changes since then, it works nicely.

Most exciting for me is the [announcement of Textile 2](http://www.textism.com/article/739/). Textile is an integral part of my developing <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> these days (I even have written permission from [Dean Allen](http://www.textism.com/) to include it in any final public release I might make).

There were a few things I had to change about the first version: it got a bit scatty for me when dealing with `del` and `ins` tag, and refused to do the right thing with `code` tags without a fair amount of mucking around. I also really wanted a detextile function for editing and began work on it before giving up. At a glance in the code of Textile 2, there seems to be an experimental version in there. Nice! I look forward to being able to mess around more with it.

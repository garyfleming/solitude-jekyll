Never write for anyone but yourself. If you do so the words won&#8217;t be heart-felt or interesting; they&#8217;ll be staid and contorted. Write because you can&#8217;t not write.

Never play for anyone but yourself. If you do so the games won&#8217;t be fun or engaging; they&#8217;ll be dull and ineffectual. Play because the games engross you.

Never dance for anyone but yourself. If you do so the moves won&#8217;t be genuine or rhytmic; they&#8217;ll be flailing and empty. Dance because you&#8217;re moved to dance.

Never live for anyone but yourself.

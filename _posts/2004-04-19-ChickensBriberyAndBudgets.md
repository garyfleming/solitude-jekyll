It&#8217;s been a while since the last random links post so this is a big one:

  * **[<acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and QuickTime](http://realdev1.realise.com/rossa/rendertest/quicktime.html)** &#8211; A standards compliant way of embedding QuickTime movies in web pages.
  * **[Princeton 3D Model Search](http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/search.html)** &#8211; Make a sketch (either 3D or 2D) and this will try to find a similar 3D model. Results are hit and miss.
  * **[KKrieger](http://www.theprodukkt.com/)** &#8211; A first person shooter in 96k. The mind boggles. It also looks pretty damn good.
  * **[String Matching Algorithms](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/)** &#8211; All the background and algorithms you&#8217;ll ever need for string matching, demonstrated by some Java applets.
  * **[Imagine You&#8217;re A Chicken](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/04/16/sour-crop/)** &#8211; Dunstan has lost it.
  * **[Game Desktops](http://www.desktopgaming.com/browse.php?browseall=yes)** &#8211; Desktop wallpapers based on classic games.
  * **[Installing Linux On A Dead Badger](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040405/badger.shtml)** &#8211; For the hardcore.
  * **[Movie Budget Records](http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/records/budgets.html)** &#8211; Most of the losses shown here were down to piss poor marketing (how many of them have you heard of, let alone seen?).
  * **[Kevin Bacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon)** &#8211; To make Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon easier.
  * **[<acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> Mime type mangling](http://philringnalda.com/blog/2004/04/getting_around_ies_mime_type_mangling.php)** &#8211; One more workaround for the worlds biggest browser. Sigh.
  * **[Bill Gates Is Not The Richest](http://in.news.yahoo.com/040404/137/2cdva.html)** &#8211; Yes, he&#8217;s been replaced as the richest business man in the world. Click through for the shock replacement.
  * **[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)** &#8211; A strange mix of Java and Python.
  * **[<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> Style Guide](http://www.asleep.net/hacking/php/style/)** &#8211; Some of this looks absolutely hideous. Really ugly code.
  * **[Xbox emulator](http://www.caustik.com/cxbx/)** &#8211; Don&#8217;t expect too much just yet.
  * **[Bribing Restaurants](http://www.epicurious.com/g_gourmet/g06_feature/james_beard/dough.html)** &#8211; Excellent tale of a man bribing his way into some exclusive establishments.
  * **[Learn The Shell](http://www.quong.com/shellin20/)** &#8211; It&#8217;s your way to an easier life, really.
  * **[Process Forking in PHP](http://www.electrictoolbox.com/article/php/process-forking/)** &#8211; Interesting&#8230;
  * **[Liam Lynch](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A19305-2004Mar23&notFound=true)** &#8211; A brief look at the life of alt.rock personified.
  * **[Tontie](http://www.kiteretsu.jp/on/tontie/)** &#8211; An insane whack a mole style game. Causes stress. Great!

That&#8217;s all for another week or two.

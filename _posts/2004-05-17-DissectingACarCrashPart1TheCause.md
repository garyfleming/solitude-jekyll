There are three main components of any car crash, although they do not seem to occur in the order one might expect. The cause (part 1) slowly burns into your conscious in the minutes and weeks following the crash.

The truth of the matter is that the real cause will never be known. It started too long ago; a chain of events, large and small, snowballing into this final collision.

Did you check the mirror? Did you see anything behind you? The blind spot is always there and becomes a matter of much self-loathing after the crash.

Maybe you did see something coming. Maybe you hoped it would be alright. Yeah, everything will be alright. Keep your eyes on the road ahead and never deviate. Focus and ignore the doubt.

Delude yourself. Do what it takes to believe that &#8220;it&#8217;ll be alright&#8221;. You are heading for [a car crash](/Archives/2004/04/27/DissectingACarCrashPart2TheMainEvent).

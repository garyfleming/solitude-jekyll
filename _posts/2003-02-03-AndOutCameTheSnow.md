For the first time in at least a year, it&#8217;s snowing here! There&#8217;s something inexplicably cool about snow (and no, I don&#8217;t just mean that it&#8217;s cold). Maybe it&#8217;s the crunching sound that fresh stuff makes under foot, maybe it&#8217;s the snowballs flying through the air, maybe&#8230; Maybe the cold has just gone to my head. I&#8217;ll try to get some pictures up later.

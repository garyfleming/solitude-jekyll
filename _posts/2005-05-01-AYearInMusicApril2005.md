The best song of the year so far goes to &#8220;Blamethrower&#8221; by [Reuben](http://www.wordsfromreuben.com). An astute mix of shouty rock and lucid vocals, a catchy chorus and riff just this side of immense mark this track as one to get. From their forthcoming second album, &#8220;Very Fast, Very Dangerous&#8221;, it is available as a download only single from various outlets (I recommend [PlayLouder](http://www.playloudershop.com/)).

As well as joining Reuben on their UK tour this month, [Caretaker](http://listen.to/caretaker) released new EP &#8220;The Sign Of Four&#8221;. Featuring some of the tightest time transitions and vocal hooks in recent times, this is a band to be watching.

However, this month was mostly about [yourcodenameis:milo](http://www.yourcodenameismilo.com). Already marked as one of the UKs best upcoming bands (having won the last Kerrang! Best British Newcomer award), they released a new single, the melodic &#8220;17&#8221;, and then their debut full length album, &#8220;Ignoto&#8221;, a week later. On the strength of the three singles (the latest joining previous stunners &#8220;Schteeve&#8221; and &#8220;Rapt. Dept.&#8221;), this was always going to be something special. The blistering live pace of songs like &#8220;I Am Connecting Flight&#8221; and &#8220;2-Stone&#8221; have made a faithful transition to <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym>, even if the dampening vocal filters mean that the songs lacks the impact that it could. Why Flood (the album&#8217;s producer) chose to apply such an effect is beyond me, since certain songs sound like poor imitations of the earlier demos. Still a great album.

After 10 years or so, [The Delgados](http://www.delgados.co.uk/) have split. It&#8217;s all amicable and Chemikal Underground will continue as a label run by the band. The reason for the split being that the bass player was leaving and the band felt they&#8217;d rather not continue without all of the original members.

[EasyTree](http://www.easytree.org/), the bittorrent tracker site for unreleased bootlegs, was shut down at the start of the month due to record industry pressure on their ISP. Shame though it is, [Dime A Dozen](http://www.dimeadozen.org/)&#8220;>has already appeared to fill the void.

In a shock move, the excellent Kerbdog have reformed. Unsure as to any official announcement on this, or what is going on with Cormac Battle&#8217;s other band, Wilt, but this news is certain. They are playing some dates in Ireland this month and next with the outstanding [Fighting With Wire](http://fightingwithwire.co.uk/). Excellent news.

Other notable releases in April were [Degrassi](http://www.degrassi.co.uk)&#8216;s &#8220;Tell Charles I&#8217;m On My Way&#8221; (looping guitar rock never sounded so good) and [Dead Fly Buchowski](http://www.deadflymustdie.tk/)&#8216;s &#8220;Russian Doll&#8221;, to which I&#8217;m somewhat indifferent but the band continue to show some promise.

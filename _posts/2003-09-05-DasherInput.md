This is one of the oddest things I&#8217;ve seen in a while. [Dasher](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/) is a way to input text using nothing but a mouse (or other pointing device).

You &#8220;drive&#8221; the mouse towards oncoming letter blocks, which lead to more letters, and eventually spell out words. The predictive features and adjustable scroll speeds mean that once you get your head around it, you can write essays pretty fast.

Infact, I wrote this entire entry using this program; <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> and all (_Dashblogging_, if you will). Given a bit more time to get used to it (it really is a bizarre thing at first), I think it could be very handy for various applications, particularly mobile input.

So, for my first update, I thought it would be nice to connect myself to the rest of the world. If you look at the navigation bar, you&#8217;ll see a small button that says [GeoURL](http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://solitude.vkps.co.uk). If you click it, you&#8217;ll get a list of blogs that have registered with GeoURL and are geographically close to me. There&#8217;s something odd about making meta-physical connections to physical places. But click on it anyway.

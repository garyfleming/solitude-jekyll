For various reasons, I&#8217;ve outgrown [nntprss](http://www.methodize.org/nntprss/) as my default <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> client (not least because it is sadly lacking in features due to the lapse in releases). So, I recently switched to [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/).

I had my first realy &#8220;holy shit, that&#8217;s cool&#8221; moment with it a few minutes ago. When subscribing to Stuart Langridge&#8217;s feed for [Kryogenix](http://kryogenix.org), I decided to look at a few of the recent posts. SortTable is one item I posted about recently (and is still in my RSS feed).

I was shocked to see, that in the item for his feed, the full text from my piece referring to his. SharpReader knew they were connected and did some implicit comment magic. Very nice.

Sorry for the geeky gush, but it took my by surprise, and I like that.

Net<acronym title="MiniDisc">MD</acronym> is a fantastic idea: hook up a NetMD player to your computer and just drag music over. Simple.

Of course, anyone who has used one can probably tell you that it isn&#8217;t that simple in practice. The default software, OpenMG (known as Sonic Stage in some areas), is dreadful. Prone to crashing, not starting up, ignoring your <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> connection, and a plethora of other problems. The only other official software available is Simple Burner. It takes a <acronym title="Compact Disc">CD</acronym> and transfers the contents over to NetMD very quickly. This, however, only helps if you want to move a CD across, and not a bunch of random songs.

Now there&#8217;s a new solution: [M3U2SimpleBurner](http://members.xoom.virgilio.it/paolose/). It is a bit of a beast to set-up (you need either [Daemon tools](http://www.daemon-tools.com) or Nero Burning <acronym title="Read Only Memory">ROM</acronym>, as well as Simple Burner and the OpenMG secure modules,

Once you&#8217;ve got it all down, you drag your mp3&#8217;s into M3U2SimpleBurner and it creates a virtual image (a fake CD that only exists on your computer). You then mount this virtual image onto a virtual drive (created by either Nero or Daemon Tools), and tell the real Simple Burner to use that.

Now, while I haven&#8217;t had a chance to use it all properly yet, it still seems like a lot less hassle than the OpenMG software. Only time will tell.

August was a relatively quiet month, with nothing particularly outstanding. Onwards anyway...

### The August Winner

There are plenty of okay films this month, but nothing excellent. For the winner, I'll go for **Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind**; as a decent look at the problems that seemingly happy people might hide.

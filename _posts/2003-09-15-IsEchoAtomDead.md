I hate to say it (especially after putting in so much effort), but is the project codenamed Atom/Echo dead? Let&#8217;s look carefully:

  1. The [Echo wiki](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage) is largely dead. A quick look at [the wiki&#8217;s recent changes](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RecentChanges) shows that work has definitely slowed right down.
  2. The [Name Voting](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/NameFinalVote) is an absolute mess. All of the originally cleared candidates have been voted out, the best names (Echo/Atom) have been deemed unviable, and the new names are&#8230; well, awful. Kitak, Mota, Syntia? Are we naming concept cars?
  3. Oh yeah, and the number of votes for each entry are very much single figures, which doesn&#8217;t look good for community adoption.
  4. The [Atom mailiing list](http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/maillist.html) has plunged in usage. From around 30 entries a day at it&#8217;s peak to, at best, 5. Ouch.
  5. The [Formerly Echo blog](http://danja.typepad.com/fecho/) is pretty dead too. Updates are sparse and short.
  6. Very little mention of it in the places we used to see it mentioned at least twice a post.

From this, we can say that work has definitely died down. But, that doesn&#8217;t quite paint a fair picture. Important avenues are being explored elsewhere.

The [Atom<acronym title="Application Interface">API</acronym>](http://bitworking.org/rfc/draft-gregorio-07.html) is doing particularly well. Amongst others, a [<acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> implementation of the API](http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/PhpAtomApiImplementation) is pretty much done, as well as PERL and Java versions. That&#8217;s a big step.

It&#8217;s tough to say. The forward motion we once saw has hit a wall. Hopefully, the apathy will clear up soon. We&#8217;ve all put in too much effort to let it die.

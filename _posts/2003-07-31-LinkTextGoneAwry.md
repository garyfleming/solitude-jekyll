[Tim Bray](http://tbray.org/ongoing/): Someone I have great respect for. His work on <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> and searching (the On Search series) is fantastic; the latter seriously influencing my own developing search tool for this site.

However, his link text is terrible. Look at this [table of contents for OnSearch](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/30/OnSearchTOC). Ouch. He uses the word &#8220;this&#8221; as the sole link text 3 times (for 3 different articles), the word &#8220;here&#8221;, and various other bits of link text that require context (&#8220;this chapter&#8221;, &#8220;herewith&#8221;).

His headers for each section are exactly what should be used as link text. They describe the article being linked to in a short phrase, without being repetitive. They&#8217;re far more accessible than the current links.

You make a plan, a plan in your head, and assume that&#8217;s how things are going to happen. They won&#8217;t.

Maybe you thought you were going to the cinema for a movie and a quiet night, but somehow you end up with a group of friends you haven&#8217;t seen in a while, drinking and chatting until the quiet hours eventually arrive.

Maybe you thought you were going to see an old friend at a certain place at a certain time, but he doesn&#8217;t show up in the three hours you wait (with others).

Maybe you really thought you were finished, but you know you&#8217;re not.

Plans change, nothing is concrete, people are unpredictable. This is not a bad thing. Life should be about the unexpected.

Maybe you should plan for the unexpected, but you&#8217;re probably planning yourself into a corner.

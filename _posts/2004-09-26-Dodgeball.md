Surprisingly, **Dodgeball** is amusing. It is dumb but, as with many Ben Stiller films, that is entirely the point. All the usual plot features can be expected: the main character learns an important life lesson, the losers become winners, the guy gets the girl, and some rather tasteless jokes.

The mark for these sorts of film can largely be determined by how many memorable lines and moments there are (I&#8217;m sure that we can all still remember the best ones from **There&#8217;s Something About Mary**). This has enough to make it amusing. That&#8217;ll do for me.

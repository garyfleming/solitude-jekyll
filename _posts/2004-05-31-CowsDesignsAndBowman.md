This is a large links post today, due to the lack of time to post it over the last few weeks (and some minor <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Processor">PHP</acronym> and permissions problems).

  * **[Bowman](http://www.xeron.org/cosas/bowman/bowmanf.html)** &#8211; An excellent flash game, with very satisfying hit noises and blood.
  * **[SpotCode](http://www.highenergymagic.com/spotcode/)** &#8211; Using your mobile phone&#8217;s camera as a pointer for your computer. Will it replace the mouse? Doubt it.
  * **[Is the ninja death touch real?](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040521.html)** &#8211; Apparently not. Well, maybe not.
  * **[Writing efficient PHP code](http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Writing-Clean-and-Efficient-PHP-Code/)** &#8211; Some stuff even I never knew, like string concatenation runs faster when using single quotes.
  * **[Fight Club: The Game](http://xbox.ign.com/objects/621/621141.html)** &#8211; The very idea sickens me.
  * **[Ticked Off Links](http://www.collylogic.com/index.php/weblog/comments/40/)** &#8211; Checkboxes on visited links. Very clever effect.
  * **[Google Software Principles](http://www.google.com/corporate/software_principles.html)** &#8211; A reasonable set of guidelines from the upcoming giant.
  * **[O&#8217;Reilly openbooks](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/)** &#8211; The tech book company give away old editions. Very forward thinking. Kudos.
  * **[Mr T Vs. Everything](http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~kljense3/MrTvs.html)** &#8211; I bet he won all of them too. He&#8217;s just that tough.
  * **[Musicology Strategy](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/columns/music_reporter_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000514645)** &#8211; Prince gives his new album away at his concerts. Very forward thinking. Kudos.
  * **[Object Oriented Improvements in PHP 5](http://www.developer.com/lang/php/article.php/3302171)** &#8211; If you&#8217;re a Java programmer, most of this will be second nature.
  * **[Backslider](http://www.noisebetweenstations.com/personal/weblogs/tinderbox/design/sketchbo/backslid.shtml)** &#8211; An interesting history browsing idea, but not sure how it&#8217;d fair with a multiple tabs and windows.
  * **[What is <acronym title="Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks">RAID</acronym>?](http://www.uni-mainz.de/~neuffer/scsi/what_is_raid.html)** &#8211; A nice overview of the various forms of RAID.
  * **[DTD mapper](http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/DTDMapper/)** &#8211; Creates a hierarchy to browser from a given <acronym title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym>. Nice.
  * **[PNG Sun demo](http://www.mozilla.org/start/1.0/demos/eagle-sun.html)** &#8211; An interesting little lighting demo for Mozilla browsers.
  * **[Scribe](http://prismicspiral.com/scribe/)** &#8211; Mozilla plug-in that saves and restores text areas upon <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>. An absolute gem.
  * **[Onion Skin Shadows](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/onionskin/)** &#8211; A good tutorial on getting rounded edges and other effects using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>.
  * **[PHP Coding Standard](http://www.alltasks.net/code/php_coding_standard.html)** &#8211; Not sure I&#8217;d agree with all of this, but not a bad start.
  * **[Detente](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/05/28/detente)** &#8211; The syndication formats all have specific purposes. Use the right one for the right goal.
  * **[Perl Operator Periodic Table](http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/blog/code/PeriodicTable.html)** &#8211; Unbelievable number of operators.
  * **[I Chased You For 12 Years&#8230;](http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/30593810.html)** &#8211; Tragic but hilarious tale.
  * **[Cows With Guns](http://www.idefag.no/idefag/nyheter/filer/cowswithguns.swf)** &#8211; Very funny flash cartoon, particularly the ending.

End. And I&#8217;ve still got enough links left for a regular size post.

Once again, the film fights are behind. Time to catch up:

**Knocked Up** is a surprisingly grown-up comedy. Expecting a bit of a gross-out, it was a pleasure to see a well-developed movie; with a decent enough plot, and even some (shock) character development. While it still has enough set-pieces to entertain (the trip to Vegas being particularly notable), it&#8217;s good to see that they&#8217;re part of the story, rather than the story being an excuse for them. It&#8217;s not a masterpiece, by any stretch, but it is worth seeing. One of the best comedies of the year.

Let&#8217;s get straight to it for the next one: **1408** is about as lazy a Stephen King adaptation as you can make (without producing utter excrement like [Dreamcatcher](/Archives/2003/05/03/Dreamcatcher/)). That&#8217;s a real shame as it has a handful of genuinely jumpy moments, before it descends into horror movie clichÃ©, dream endings, and King&#8217;s own silly trappings: haunted inanimate objects. Cusack does the best he can with the material, while Samuel L Jackson phones in his five minute performance. Pretty dreadful, despite a decent opening.

As I&#8217;m sure many have realised by now, **Run, Fatboy, Run** is not a Simon Pegg film. Sure, he stars in it, but I&#8217;d be willing to bet that his 3rd-tier writing credit is due to the handful of jokes he wrote for it (and I&#8217;d bet on which ones they are). David Schwimmer, as director, proves himself woefully incompetent. He manages to create a fairly one-dimensional world, with painfully unrounded characters and poor motivations. It being a comedy is no excuse, as Pegg himself has proven time and again, for simply holding up a flimsy premise as completed material and running some fart jokes through it. Apart from the outstandingly funny Dylan Moran, this film is without merit.

Finally, **Michael Clayton** has George Clooney as a kind of fixer lawyer, dropped in to solve problems. Although he&#8217;s supposed to be great at it, the character isn&#8217;t doing so well. His best friend has gone nuts and is going against a multi-million dollar client. The main problem with this film is direction: it meanders in the set-up, and fails to really get going at any decent pace. The performances are strong, and the story is interesting enough, it&#8217;s just not going to really grab anyone.

It&#8217;s a tough choice, and Clooney nearly had it, but I think the winner from these four has to be **Knocked Up**.

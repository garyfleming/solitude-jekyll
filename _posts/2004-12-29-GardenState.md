**Garden State** was surprising. Expecting a fairly lightweight comedy about a life going out of control, it was pleasant to actually be watching a film that was more than a passable script with some funny moments.

While the first few scenes are self-indulgent and overly sweet appetisers, the meat of the film is both tender and succulent. A boy, a girl, friends, and a trip home; it writes itself.

A plot synopsis does not do this film justice. See it. See it for the beautiful insight into a life that seems messed up enough to be real. See it for the old friends who seem to genuinely care beyond standard Hollywood &#8220;loyalty&#8221;. See it because it is genuinely funny. Just see it.

Three films to finish off the year&#8230;

First up, **Sightseers** is, like its characters, an oddity. It&#8217;s a dark comedy about finding love, breaking free of the things that hold you back, and murder. From the off, everything feels a little off, but not enough to be ridiculous. Things quickly descend, while staying true to the primary theme of love. It&#8217;s funny and slightly horrifying at times, in a way that really works for the move. Definitely worth seeing. (See [my Sightseers Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/275728362436194304)).

**The Man With The Iron Fists**, on the other hand (pardon the pun), is a very modern take on old martial arts films, with vague mysticism, clans, fighting, slightly camp villains, and general silliness. The fight sequences themselves are as over-the-top as you might expect and always fun to watch, even when some of the acting goes a little bit far for the B-movie joke. It&#8217;s as terrible and gaudy as intended. If you can appreciate the style, it&#8217;s a decent watch.   (See [my The Man With The Iron Fists Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/281151531510816769)).

Finally, **Safety Not Guaranteed** is about journalists investigating an advert requesting a partner to travel in time. Expecting a prank or a nutcase, one gets drawn into the world of the stranger who posted the advert, whilst another tries to reunite with a lost love. Gimmick aside, the film is an interesting look at missed opportunities, the things that we wonder &#8220;what if?&#8221; about. On that level, it&#8217;s a good film, but the execution can, at times, be a little indie-by-numbers. You&#8217;ll get a feel for how it&#8217;s going to play out pretty quickly. Decent. (See [my Safety Not Guaranteed Twitter review](https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/285419285373935616)).

The winner for December is **Sightseers**. Where the other two flounder at times, Sightseers stays on path, even when things get strange.

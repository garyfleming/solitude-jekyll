**Identity** (starring [John Cusack](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Cusack,John) and [Ray Liotta](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Liotta,Ray)) is stylish, tense, genuinely creepy and, ultimately, stupid.

The basic premise is interesting enough: a bunch of strangers get stranded together at a motel until morning, their numbers lessening as the night unfolds. So far, so slasher flick. But the strangers come to realise that they all have a connection to each other and they might not be their by accident after all. At this point, there is a real sense of sinister going-ons.

And then the words &#8220;ancient Indian burial ground&#8221; are mentioned. Thankfully, however, that most laughable of plot devices is never capitalised on. Instead, we&#8217;re subjected to something far more embarrasing; the sort of surprise only a writer who ran out of interest could come up with. The audience left laughing.

A perfect example of a movie ruined by a twist.

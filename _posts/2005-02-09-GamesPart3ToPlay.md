Yes, this series is moving on far slower than I said it would. I blame university. Anyway, today I&#8217;m going to link to a series of very different games.

  * **[Game And Watch Emulators](http://www.4colorrebellion.com/index.php?p=44)** &#8211; Several slices of classic twitch gaming. I thoroughly recommend Donkey Kong Jr., a game which gave me hours of pleasure as a child. Incidentally, I still have the originals of most of these. These are, unfortunately, Windows only executables.
  * **[Puzzle Bobble](http://www.ventoline.com/frozenbubble/bustamove.html)** &#8211; Or Bust A Move if you prefer the non-European title. A flawless recreation of Taito&#8217;s fast moving, precision puzzler that spawned a dozen clones (Flash).
  * **[Grid Game](http://www.columbia.edu/~chc18/gridgame.swf)** &#8211; Pretty, simple, frustratingly addictive; all signs of a good puzzle game. On my first go, I managed a chain of 1407. I&#8217;ve yet to beat it and it&#8217;s annoying me enough to keep trying. Actually, I take that back: just as I was writing this post I managed 2364. Eat that, [Derek](http://mrry.co.uk).
  * **[Prince Of Persia: Special Edition](http://princeofpersiagame.com/minigame/game/flash/index.html)** &#8211; A new adventure in the vein of the original Prince Of Persia. Shame that it has a time limit. The controls are as shite as ever.

Enjoy. Next up: handhelds.
